  Our 2017 Qualification Round saw a record number of registrants (almost
  64,000 &mdash; we may need to upgrade our unsigned short variable if this
  keeps up!) Difficulty-wise, the round was somewhere between the legendarily
  tough 2015 and the milder 2016. Over 25,000 contestants solved at least one
  dataset, and about 500 managed perfect scores! xiaowuc1 continued a now five-year
  streak of submitting the first correct dataset, and didn't even need two minutes
  this time! y0105w49 was the first to submit every dataset correctly, but with
  one four-minute penalty; FatalEagle swooped in shortly afterward, with no
  penalties, to snatch first place.

  <i>Oversized Pancake Flipper</i> was this year's obligatory pancake-themed
  problem. (We don't know how much longer this tradition will go on; we may
  need some help from the Infinite House of Pancake Problem Ideas!)
  <i>Tidy Numbers</i> had a tougher Large that required some attention to
  edge cases. Perhaps because of its more tempting point value, more contestants
  attempted it than A, though the numbers of contestants getting A-Large and
  B-Large right were very similar.
  <i>Bathroom Stalls</i> was a three-dataset problem that rewarded
  various levels of optimization; its two Smalls were useful insurance for solvers
  who weren't quite sure about their A-Large or B-Large answers. <i>Fashion Show</i>
  presented an unusual story that disguised a chess piece problem that could be
  simplified with one cool insight. Even its Small was quite tough, only garnering
  around 1000 solves.

  Over 18,000 contestants advanced to the Round 1s by earning 25 points or more. If
  you advanced, we hope to see you in under a week for Round 1A! Regardless of
  how you fared, we hope you had a great time with the problems. Check out the
  analyses for the problems for various interesting observations and alternate
  solution methods.
