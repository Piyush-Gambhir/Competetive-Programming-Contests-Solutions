  The last of our Round 1 sub-rounds is over! A further 1000 contestants have
  advanced to Round 2 and Distributed Round 1. For those of you who did not
  advance, we hope that you found the Round 1 problems enjoyable, and we
  certainly hope to see you back next year!

  This round featured <i>Ample Syrup</i>, a surprise additional pancake-themed
  problem for 2017. Although it was superficially geometry-based, it was really
  more about reducing the complexity of a search space.
  <i>Parenting Partnering</i> was inspired by real life events on the Code
  Jam team; to solve it, it helped to think carefully about intervals and have
  a greedy insight. Finally, <i>Core Training</i> was a bit of a wild card. The
  first dataset is tractable, and solving it provides a hint toward the solution
  of the second dataset, but getting there still required some tricky observations
  and perhaps some experimentation.  Even with multiple attempts allowed, less than
  1% of the people who solved the first dataset went on to solve the second one
  correctly!

  Slightly more than 1000 coders scored 57 points or better, which is the score achieved
  for solving both datasets for the first two problems, so almost all of those people will
  advance to the next round.

  EgorKulikov won the round, solving all three problems with a time of 43:59.  Seven more
  coders also got a perfect score of 100.
