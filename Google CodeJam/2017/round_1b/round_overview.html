  We're trotting through the Round 1s one weekend at a time, and Round 1B
  featured a lot of horsepower. Perhaps you used a test harness, or
  accidentally started your Java program with
  <code>public static void mane</code>, or tried to print in C++ using
  <code>colt &lt;&lt; </code>, or attempted to reserve memory in C using
  <code>gallop</code>. At least we didn't give you a problem on the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set" target="_blank">Canter set</a> or make you
  write an

  <i>Steed 2: Cruise Control</i> riffed on a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_2:_Cruise_Control" target="_blank">1990s movie franchise</a>;
  its author came up with it while stuck in slow traffic! It was a potentially
  complicated-looking problem that turned out to have a straightforward
  solution. In <i>Stable Neigh-bors</i>, figuring out how to arrange unicorns
  was only half the fun; the implementation was potentially tricky! Finally,
  <i>Pony Express</i> was a graph problem with an unconventional solution.

  This round's hardest problem proved significantly easier than Round 1A's, allowing JAPLJ to claim first place really early with a perfect score with no wrong tries in under 40 minutes! When the dust settled, 347 contestants achieved perfect scores. About 800 other contestants managed to solve all problems except one Large, and most of them had enough points or a low enough penalty to qualify to Round 2.

  Our top 1,000 from this round advance to Round 2, joining the 1,000 who
  advanced from Round 1A. There's still one more chance to advance in Round 1C next week!
