  This year's Round 2 started off with another tasty treat:
  <i>Fresh Chocolate</i>, which asked contestants to work within rules set
  down by a miserly chocolate factory owner. Some greedy insights and
  case-based analysis were sufficient to solve the problem.
  <i>Roller Coaster Scheduling</i> also had a greedy solution, but it was
  much harder to get there! <i>Beaming With Joy</i> was about reducing a grid
  of laser beams to a satisfiability problem, and <i>Shoot the Turrets</i> was
  a challenging graph problem that involved an incremental series of matchings.
  As usual, there was a substantial jump in difficulty between the Round 1s and
  Round 2!
</p><p>
  This round was tougher than even the typical Round 2. Quite a few former
  Round 3 advancers and finalists had trouble with the Large datasets of the
  A and B problems, and C and D certainly weren't any simpler than those! D in
  particular was quite tough, with only 19 correct Large solutions. Even the
  Smalls of B through D were tricky in their own right.

  jsannemo was the first to obtain a perfect score, in
  just under 1 hour and 44 minutes, and six more contestants (EgorKulikov, shik, fagu, krijgertje, Endagorion, and matthew99) followed with their own 100s.
  Congratulations &mdash; that's no easy feat!
  The top 500 cutoff turned out to be 37 points plus some speed (usually
  A + B), and the top 1000 (T-shirt) cutoff was 25 points, or 23 points plus a <i>lot</i> of speed!
</p><p>
  Our top 1000 contestants in this round win this year's edition of the
  coveted Code Jam T-shirt, and our top 500 advance to the even tougher Round
  3 &mdash; the last online round before the World Finals! Even if you did not
  advance or win a shirt, it is still quite an accomplishment to make it to
  Round 2! And, of course, Distributed Round 1 will offer another
  T-shirt opportunity, plus the chance to advance along the parallel
  Distributed track. Don't miss it!
