  Round 1A is over, and it had a particularly tough C problem; only 124
  contestants attempted the Large, and only 8 got it right! Believe it or
  not, this was not the most brutally difficult Round 1 problem in Code Jam
  history; that (dubious?)
  honor still goes to Pseudominion
  from Round 1A 2011.

  Fortunately, problems A and B (and the Small of Problem C) were far more
  approachable. To advance, you needed to either get more than 56 points (e.g., by
  solving A, B, and C-small), or get 56 points by solving A and B with a total
  penalty time around two hours.

  <i>Alphabet Cake</i> was a reminder that the GCJ staff is aware of forms of
  cake other than pan"cake"s. It allowed various approaches, including a nifty
  recursive one. <i>Ratatouille</i> was another food-related problem (we must
  have been unusually hungry this year!), and it involved wrangling ratios in
  recipes. Finally, <i>Play the Dragon</i> presented a game in which coming up
  with the right strategy would get you the Small, but only very careful
  implementation and attention to detail would slay the dreaded Large!

  Congratulations to our top 1,000 in this round, who advanced to Round 2,
  and to Eryx, our winner, who finished with a commanding 40-minute lead over
  the field! (pperm, xyz11, Nore, kmjp and mk.al13n also pulled off perfect scores.)
  Even if you didn't advance, we still have Rounds 1B and 1C
  remaining. As usual, we encourage you to take a look at the analyses to check out
  our approaches and commentary.
