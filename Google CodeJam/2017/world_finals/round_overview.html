  This year, we served up another set of six tough problems for our strongest
  contestants to chew on. <i>Dice Straight</i> was the most approachable of the
  six, and could be solved via max flow. <i>Operation</i> required several
  observations in order to make the underlying dynamic programming problem
  tractable. The unusual <i>Spanning Planning</i> asked contestants to construct
  a graph with a certain exact number of spanning trees; it turned out to be
  possible to solve the problem with a randomized algorithm!
  <i>Omnicircumnavigation</i> involved a perennially tough programming contest
  problem topic: geometry on a sphere. <i>Stack Management</i> presented a
  simple-sounding solitaire-style card game; there was a relatively simple way to
  determine whether each game was winnable, but it was very hard to see! Finally,
  <i>Teleporters</i> was another 3D geometry problem that required careful
  thought and implementation.

  As usual, most contestants chose to work on earlier problems first; A, B, and
  even the unusual C got many submissions. Our defending champion
  <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> did not appear on the scoreboard at all until the
  2:30 mark, but he had clearly used the preceding time well; in the last hour,
  he submitted six more datasets, and reached 120 points with 10 minutes to go!
  <b>SnapDragon</b> overtook him in the last minute with a submission for D-large,
  jumping to 130 points, but alas, it was incorrect. That left Gennady as our
  <i>four-time</i> Code Jam champion! <b>zemen</b> took second with 110;
  <b>vepifanov</b> was third thanks to a successful last-minute D-large
  submission; <b>SnapDragon</b> was fourth. There were no successful
  submissions for E-large and F-large; this was one of our toughest final rounds
  yet!
</p><p>
  As always, we congratulate all 26 of our finalists, and we thank everyone who
  competed this year! We hope that you will all join us again in 2018 for another
  Code Jam tournament.
