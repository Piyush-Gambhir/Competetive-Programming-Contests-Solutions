  Round 3 started off with the relatively accessible <i>Googlements</i> problem,
  in which a bit of combinatorics knowledge saved some time.
  <i>Good News and Bad News</i> asked contestants to assign weights to directed
  edges in a graph to achieve a particular goal; it could be solved via a
  construction or a sufficiently well-designed randomized algorithm.
  <i>Mountain Tour</i> was a complex-looking graph problem that boiled down to
  one interesting key insight, and <i>Slate Modern</i> was a challenging
  implementation exercise to round out the set.

  It was an exciting contest! The lead changed many times in the first hour and a half. Gennady.Korotkevich was the first to hit 74 points, with vepifanov following a mere 8 seconds later! kevinsogo was the
  first of only four contestants to solve the tough Large of Slate Modern, over an hour and a half into the contest, and that plus other solves propelled him to a victory; he was the only contestant to reach 76 points. The Large of Mountain Tour was more widely solved, and the cutoff for the top 25 turned out to be 74 points and a finishing time under 2:30.

  We'll see our finalists in August in Dublin, where they will compete for a
  $15,000 prize and the title of Code Jam World Champion! Will
  Gennady.Korotkevich successfully defend his title to become a
  consecutive four-time champion? Or will kevinsogo, who took second place in last year's Finals, repeat the first-place performance that we just saw in Round 3? Or will we see something completely different? Find out next time!
