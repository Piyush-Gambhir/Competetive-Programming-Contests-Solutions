  The second subround of Google Code Jam 2008 Round 1, consisted of three
  problems.
</p><p>
  The first problem is a combination of geometry and combinatorics principles
  and was a bit on the hard side for the 15 points it was valued at.
</p><p>
  The second problem was a blend between the Sieve of Erastosthenes and data structures.
</p><p>
  The third problem was based on a classic solitaire
  <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mousetrap.html" target="_blank">card game</a>.
  This one occurs to many as a standard exercise in data structures, like
  interval trees. However, here we will include a clever, simple solution that
  suits this problem very well.
</p><p>
  This time, 39 contestants succeded in solving every input correctly from a
  total of 1715 who solved at least one dataset. The fastest to solve all tests
  was bmerry who took less than an hour!
