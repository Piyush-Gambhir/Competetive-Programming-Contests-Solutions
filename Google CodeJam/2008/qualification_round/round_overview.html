  This was the inaugural round for Google Code Jam 2008, and the first real
  contest run on our own platform!  Over 11044 people competed, and 6744 of
  them solved at least one full problem to advance to Round 1.  576
  participants solved all the datasets correctly, including our fun little
  geometry problem.
</p><p>
  We had competitors from 118 different countries, 104 of which had at least
  one qualifier; India, the United States and China were the top three in
  participants.
</p><p>
  And finally, perhaps the most exciting fact about our qualification round:
  contestants used over 40 programming languages to solve the problems.
</p><p>
  We hope you liked the problems! Congratulations to the people who qualified,
  and good luck in the remaining rounds!
