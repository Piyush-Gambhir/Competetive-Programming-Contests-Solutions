  This was another exciting round with four cute problems.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A: An easy exercise in dynamic programming.</li>
  <li>B: A puzzle in 2d geometry.</li>
  <li>
    C: A problem with a beautiful picture in 3d geometry... but the judges
    overlooked a step in the solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    D: A standard dynamic programming on graphs hidden behind a clever
    reduction.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This round caused some minor trouble for the judges. All four sample solution
  writers overlooked a key step in the reasoning, and the team had to spend a
  whole evening rejudging the problem. Fortunately, the change did not have a
  substantial effect on the list of advancers. This is the only time this year
  when we had an error in the judges' solutions, and we dodged the bullet. We
  hope to have zero mistakes in the future!

  Thanks to all the participants, especially <b>neal.wu</b>, who first suspected
  that we had an error and pointed it out.
