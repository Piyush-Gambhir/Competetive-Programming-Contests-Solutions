  The first sub-round of Google Code Jam 2008 Round 1 featured three little
  challenges. Each problem required one or two cute ideas to solve.
</p><p>
  The first problem is formulated in one of the important concepts connecting
  algebra and geometry, that of scalar product, also known as inner product.
  Though the problem itself is an exercise in arrays and numbers.
</p><p>
  The second problem, as mundane as the name suggests, has some connection to
  the propositional logic, especially the satisfiability problem. Unlike the
  super-hard general satisfiability problem, this one is in a restricted form,
  and thus allows one to find a simple and cute solution.
</p><p>
  The third problem, appears as a numerical problem, actually should be solved
  with only integer numbers. With ideas from elementary algebra, combinatorics,
  and number theory, armed with some standard tricks on the computational side,
  we know at least four different solutions with distinct flavor.

  2394 contestants finished the match with a positive score, among them, we
  have 41 perfect scores.
