  This is the first local onsite final of the 2008 Code Jam. We had four
  problems with different styles, two of them unconventional for different
  reasons.
</p><p>
  Problem C, the Millionaire, is one of the rare gems in the programming
  contests that, at first glance, is continuous and offers an infinite search
  space. The beautiful solution makes the problem discrete, and reminds us of
  some classical puzzles of recursive reasoning. Players from Japan did really
  well on this problem. 8 Japanese players qualified for the world finals; all
  of them solved the small dataset of this problem, which is almost as hard as
  the large dataset.
</p><p>
  Problem B, Apocalypse Soon, is another type of big puzzle. The solution is
  really simple, but you need to see through the properties of the game with
  very good intuition to believe that the code is really just a trivial
  simulation. Under such pressure, with the other nice and hard problems, it is
  not a big surprise that this one had the least number of correct submissions.
  The top two scorers both solved left this problem to the end.
</p><p>
  Problem A, What Are Birds, was meant to be the easy problem here. The best way
  to solve it is to visualize it as a cute geometry problem. The problem is far
  from trivial. Several players solved a more difficult problem yet still missed
  the qualification just because they did not succeed on this one.
</p><p>
  Problem D, Modern Art Plagiarism, had the biggest point value. It is a
  standard graph problem, with a nice solution using matchings. It turns out we
  have more contestants who solved D than B or C. This implies that many of our
  players are well trained in classical algorithms.
</p><p>
  Again, we had scores of 100 in this match. They are two of the favorites,
  <b>ACRush</b> and <b>Ahyangyi</b>, both from China. Around 30 minutes before
  the end of the contest we saw a duel for the top spot. They both had the last
  program -- for problem C -- almost ready, but soon submitted 6 wrong
  submissions to C-small. Finally, they fixed their bugs. <b>Ahyangyi</b> was
  the first to finish all the problems, but had 3 more wrong submissions.
  <b>ACRush</b> was the winner of the APAC final, with a lower penalty score.
</p><p>
  Congratulations to all the participants. It was a wonderful match.
