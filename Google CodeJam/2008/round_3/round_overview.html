  The last online round of Google Code Jam 2008 turned out to be an exciting
  feast of dynamic programming, plane geometry, discrete geometry, basic graph
  search, bipartite matching, combinatorics and number theory -- all in the time
  span of two hours. The problems got more challenging, and the contest more and
  more exciting.

  Before the game, our own Tomek Czajka took a look at the problems and made
  some amazing conjectures about the contest statistics. One of them was that
  the first person would complete all the problems in 100 minutes. This
  conjecture was proved by <b>bmerry</b> in a very nice way. All the problems
  were finished at the 98th minute. In addition, <b>bmerry</b> add 4 minutes of
  penalty for a wrong submission. The only other player with a perfect score was
  <b>yuhch123</b>, a Chinese high school student, with a correct submission in
  the last 5 minutes of the contest.

  In 3rd position was <b>halyavin</b>, seemingly only seconds away from the last
  submission. In the last 5 minutes, many contestants (including 13 of the top
  20) submitted something correct.
