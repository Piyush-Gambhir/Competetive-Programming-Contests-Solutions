<h3>A feast of square boards</h3>
<p>
  We present five problems we like very much for the Google Code Jam 2008 world
  final. Not until the committee selected all the problems did we find out that
  the rectangular board of unit squares clearly appears in four of the five
  problems. Only the first problem is an exception. Does that make the contest
  imperfect in a perfectionist's eyes? Not at all! See the picture in our
  analysis for that problem.
</p><p>
  Yet that is just a nice coincidence. Each of the five problems have its
  distinct nature under the cover of these beautiful rectangular grids.
</p>

<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>
<p>
  Our last problem is called <i>The Year of Code Jam</i>. So is that another
  nice coincidence? Maybe.
</p><p>
  The original author certainly made the name and the good story intentionally.
  However, the author did not realize a crucial trick. As a result, two easier
  version of this problem were created, none exciting enough to be selected as
  the last problem for the final round. Until one day Tomek Czajka looked at
  them and said, "We just need to change it slightly to be a bipartite graph,
  and here is a nice trick one can use..."
</p><p>
  A bigger story was centered around the problem <i>Bridge Builders</i>. Why is
  it "bigger"? Because (1) it was the first problem the committee selected for
  the final round, months before the competition, with all the members voting
  for it. And (2) up until the day before the final round, it was still unclear
  whether we would use the problem, with debates raging and whiteboards covered
  in faulty proofs.
</p><p>
  So the story goes like this. Yes, the committee liked it very much. One needs
  good intuition to see that this is a cute version of minimum weighted spanning
  tree problem. The committee saw that, and proved it, and the problem was
  sitting there for months.
</p><p>
  Months later, a week before the contest, it was time to finalize the problems.
  The committee found out that the proof was incomplete. It did not look too
  difficult to fix, but the task turned out to be tricky. As long as the
  algorithm was correct, we valued the intuition required to come up with the
  solution. After a series of debates, discussions, refutations, and
  verifications, we finally got a proof one day before the contest. The proof
  was mainly due to Derek Kisman and Christopher Hendrie.

<h3>At the world finals</h3>
<p>
  11,000 of you competed in the first round of Google Code Jam 2008, and on
  Friday morning the top 100 went head-to-head in Mountain View to vie for the
  top spot. After 3 hours of grueling competition and a problem set that could
  make your head spin, we had a winner: ACRush of China, jumping into first
  place with 6 minutes, 40 seconds to go. Innovative.Cat of China came in
  second, finishing the same set of problems with 5 minutes, 44 seconds left.
  And a mere 2 points behind them, the difference between two larges, was bmerry
  of South Africa; he burned through most of the problem set with 1/3 of the
  contest to go, but couldn't quite finish it off. Everyone solved our easiest
  problem, and six people solved the hardest one (which was six more than many
  of us expected!)
</p><p>
  Congratulations to all of Friday's contestants, and to everyone who competed
  in GCJ 2008!
