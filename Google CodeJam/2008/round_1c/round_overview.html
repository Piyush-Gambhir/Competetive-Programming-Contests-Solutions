  In this last sub-round of Google Code Jam 2008 Round 1, 2240 contestants
  solved at least one dataset, 17 among them got the perfect score of 100
  points.
</p><p>
  The first problem was the easiest one among the 9 Round 1 problems. It is
  interesting to note that there were contestants from the first page of the
  scoreboard who solved all of the datasets, except for A-large.
</p><p>
  In the second problem, dynamic programming, a common topic in programming
  contests, made its first appearance in this tournament. We intended this to be
  an easy dynamic programming problem with a little trick in number theory. From
  the scoreboard we can tell that this is not a trivial problem.
</p><p>
  The last problem, with a nice story, can be regarded as an exercise in data
  structures. In fact, the small dataset can be solved using standard dynamic
  programming. For the large dataset, one needs a way to speed it up. In this
  analysis we introduce an implementation that uses a binary indexed tree.
