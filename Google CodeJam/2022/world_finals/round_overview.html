  Code Jam 2022 World Finals were exciting until the last second, with
  many changes at the top of the scoreboard. The problems proved challenging
  as no problem was solved by everyone, and nobody solved every problem.
  The first problem,
  <i>Wonderland Chase</i>, was a classical graph theory problem with a novel observation.
  <i>Goose, Goose, Ducks?</i> came after as a logic-based problem, something unusual
  in programming contests. Then, <i>Slide Parade</i> seemed to be about paths,
  but ended up being a matching problem. The two most valuable problems were
  <i>Schr&ouml;dinger and Pavlov</i>, a very unusual dynamic programming problem that
  not many contestants could solve, and <i>Triangles</i>, a hard geometry problem
  with a simple statement and a complicated solution that no contestant managed to find
  in time.

  We hope that Code Jam 2022 was fun for everyone and gave you a new opportunity
  to sharpen your problems solving skills. We look forward to seeing everyone
  back again in 2022 for our twentieth anniversary!
