<p>Round 1C started with <i>Letter Blocks</i> which had contestants trying to stack towers of blocks into one megatower while adhearing to certain guidelines. Next, <i>Squary</i> tested contestants' mathematical skills as they tried to make a list of numbers "squary". Finally, <i>Intranets</i> truly put contestants to the test and had an extremely hard Test Set 2 asking for the probability that a network using a suboptimal routing algorithm would be broken up into a certain number of sub-networks.</p>

<p>
The first perfect score took just over an hour, which was longer than both of the other Round 1s.
This gave <b>Laurie666</b> first place in the round. <b>VArtem</b> and <b>square1001</b> came in
second and third place, respectively. Ultimately, 8 coders managed a perfect score.
The unofficial cutoff to advance to Round 2 is 34 points.
