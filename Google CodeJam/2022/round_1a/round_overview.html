<p>
<p>Round 1A started with <i>Double or One Thing</i> that surely required double the normal thinking to solve. Next, <i>Equal Sum</i> was a unique interactive problem that had contestants solving an NP-complete problem with a twist. Finally, <i>Weightlifting</i> gave contestants a good workout while they optimized the ordering of weights on an exercise machine.</p>

<p><b>Benq</b> was the first one with a perfect score, and that gave them the top position in the final standings. <b>ecnerwala</b> and <b>Geothermal</b> rounded out the top 3 with only a few more minutes of penalty. More than 300 people managed a perfect score. Over 9000 people scored some points out of the more than 10000 that submitted a solution.</p>

<p>When the hidden results were revealed, the contestant in 1500th place had 56 points, which is the unofficial cutoff for advancing. Come back once results are finalized to see the final look of the scoreboard.</p>

<p>Congratulations to all advancers! If you did not advance, you have two more chances in Round 1B and Round 1C. <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/schedule">See the schedule</a> to find out when and mark your calendar!
