  Code Jam's 2022 Round 2 was a different kind of challenge, with no easy points on the table.
  The first problem, <i>Spiraling Into Control</i> had competitors taking shortcuts through a strange
  house with plenty of rooms. Some clever observations could be made that help solve this problem.
  Next was <i>Pixelated Circle</i> which required some math and proofs to quickly identify missing
  pixels in an incorrect implementation of a 2D circle-drawing program. <i>Saving the Jelly</i>
  followed and required some matching and graph algorithms to help save Mr. Jolly's favorite candy.
  Finally, <i>I, O Bot</i> rounded out the set with contestants helping a robot cleanup giant
  beachballs after a giant moon party.

  <b>Um_nik</b> was the fastest to a perfect score at 1 hour and 46 minutes, and with no penalty
  attempts, which assured them the top position. <b>Benq</b> followed just a few minutes behind, also
  solving all four problems on their first try. <b>djq_cpp</b> rounded out the top 3 by solving all
  four problems with few enough penalty attempts to secure their 3rd place position.
  In the end, over 3000 contestants got a positive number of points.
  The preliminary cutoff to advance to Round 3 is 25 points and a low enough penalty.

  The results will be reviewed in the coming days. Those who are in the top 1000 after the round is
  finalized will advance to the last elimination round of the year! There are 3 weeks to get
  ready for Round 3 (see the
