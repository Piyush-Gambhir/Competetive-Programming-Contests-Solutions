  This year's Round 3 was different than any of our past rounds. None of the problems were easy,
  and more importantly, we had two interactive problems in the same round for the first time ever.
  <i>Revenge of GoroSort</i> was another interactive sorting problem which required some
  knowledge about permutations and a bit of research / trial and error. <i>Duck, Duck, Geese</i>
  was the only typical competitive programming problem that was about data structures.
  <i>Mascot Maze</i> was highly idea-oriented, where getting the right insight led to a
  straightforward implementation. Finally, there was a large jump in difficulty to the
  second interactive problem of the round, <i>Win as Second</i>, which was about game theory
  and had contestants play around in a tree.
</p><p>
  About 10 minutes into the contest the first submissions that solved <i>Revenge of GoroSort</i> in
  full started coming in. But it wasn't until almost 2 hours that someone got a perfect score.
  <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> was the first one there, and claimed the first place in the round.
  <b>Benq</b>, <b>SpyCheese</b>, and <b>Um_nik</b> were the other three that managed to do it
  and rounded out the top 4. The unofficial cutoff to make it to the finals is 71 points and a
  low enough penalty.
</p><p>
  The results will be reviewed in the coming days. Those who are in the top 25 after the round is
  finalized will advance to the Virtual World Finals!
