<p>Round 1B kicked off with a favorite Code Jam theme in <i>Pancake Deque</i> which had contestants’ mouths watering as they worked to serve pancakes from a deque in the optimal order. Next, <i>Controlled Inflation</i> required some optimizations then dynamic programming as contestants helped quickly inflate everyone’s sports balls and giant parade balloon animals. Finally, <i>Asedatab</i> truly put contestants to the test as they fought against an adversarial judge while trying to reset a database’s record value to 0.</p>

<p><b>andrewgu</b> was the first one with a perfect score, and that gave them the top position in the final standings. <b>georgerapeanu</b> and <b>Iftekhar_Hakim_K</b> rounded out the top 3 with only a few more minutes of penalty. Just over 100 people managed a perfect score. Over 9000 people scored some points out of the more than 11000 that submitted a solution.</p>

<p>When the hidden results were revealed, the contestant in 1500th place had 85 points, which is the unofficial cutoff for advancing. The Code Jam team will spend a few days finalizing the results. You can have fun reading the analyses in the problem pages while you wait. </p>

<p>Congratulations to all advancers, and for everyone else, there is one more chance to advance to Round 2 in less than a week.
