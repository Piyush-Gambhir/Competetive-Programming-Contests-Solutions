  Although Code Jam's 19th season kicked off on what many around the world call "April Fools' Day,"
  the Qualification Round was no joke!
</p><p>
  For the third time, the Qualification Round had five problems! The first problem was about
  <i>Punched Card Python</i>, which is a fun new language that (if you didn't notice
  during the round) we accepted submissions in! The language option served as a throwback to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card" target="_blank">punched cards</a>, and we're
  happy to say that 140 users enjoyed experimenting in this new language during the round. Special
  congratulations to <b>htamas</b> who was the only contestant to solve all problems using
  <i>Punched Card Python</i>!
</p><p>
  After working with punched cards at the start, participants had to quickly shift gears to
  <i>3D Printing</i> where they had to find a color all three printers had enough ink for. Next
  came <i>d1000000</i> where participants tested their luck with dice and had to find the max
  length straight that could be made. Both of these problems could be solved using a greedy
  algorithm. Things ramped up in difficulty with <i>Chain Reactions</i>, which required doing
  a clever tree traversal to get the full points. Finally, participants found
  themselves in a cave while trying to solve a probabilistic interactive problem called
  <i>Twisty Little Passages</i>.
</p><p>
  Contestants stormed out of the gate with a total of 325 submissions passing the samples in
  the first 10 minutes, with several contestants solving the first 3 problems in that time!
  <b>pwypeanut</b> was the first to score a perfect 100 points in just over 35 minutes to
  secure their victory. <b>ksun48</b>, <b>ecnerwala</b>, and <b>neal_wu</b> also solved all
  5 problems in under 45 minutes.
</p><p>
  In the end, 32702 contestants submitted something, with 31491 getting points. When the final
  results were revealed, 28111 scored at least 30 points and advanced to Round 1. 361 contestants
  went above and beyond and managed to score a perfect 100 points.

  Thank you for joining us for another year of Code Jam! If you got at least 30
  points, congratulations, you have advanced! We will see you in any of the
  Round 1s, starting with Round 1A next week. (You can keep participating in Round
  1s until you advance to Round 2.) If you did not score enough points to
  get to Round 1 this time, we hope you'll join us in 2023!
