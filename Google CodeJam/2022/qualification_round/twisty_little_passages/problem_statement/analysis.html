<h3>Code Jam 2022 - Qualification Round</h3><h1>Analysis: Twisty Little Passages</h1><p>
In general, we can't just teleport to every room, because N can be much larger than K.
We could teleport to a randomly-chosen subset of the rooms, calculate
the average degree (number of adjoining passages) of those rooms we've visited, and assume that this
is a good estimate of the average degree of all the rooms.
The number of passages is half the sum of the room degrees (since each passage connects two rooms.)
<p>
When can this approach yield a poor estimate?  If a small subset of the rooms have a degree
much higher or much lower than the median degree, then we might not visit any of them,
and our estimate would be too high or too low.
<p>
Cases where most rooms have high degree and a small number of rooms have low degree are not a
problem, because we are judged on relative error, and the relative error in this case is low.
If the average degree is 100 but we estimate that it is 103, we would only be 3% from the answer.
But if the average degree is 5 and we estimate that it is 2, we would be 60% away from the answer!
<p>
So consider a troublesome case where most rooms have low degree, and a small set of rooms have high
degree &mdash; few enough that we are unlikely to find one of them by
teleporting randomly.
If these rooms contribute a significant fraction of the total number of passages, then they must
connect to a significant fraction of the total set of rooms.
So we can find these with high probability by repeatedly teleporting to a random room and then
walking through a random passage with the "W" command.
<p>
Consider a series of rounds where we alternate between teleporting to a random room with the "T"
command and walking through a random passage with the "W" command.
We cannot simply extrapolate the average degree for the whole cave from the average degree of all
the rooms we've seen &mdash; the rooms we reach with "W" commands are not a uniform sample.
We can, however, use the average degree of just the rooms we visited with the "T" command as our
estimate for all the rooms we haven't visited, and then add the known degrees to that.
This is sufficient to solve the problem.
<p>
Another solution is to use an alternating series of "T" and "W" commands as above, and then use a
technique called <a href="https://google.com/search?q=importance+sampling" target="_blank">importance sampling</a>.
Each visit to a room gives us a sample of the average degree, but each room does not have an equal
chance of being visited in any given sample.
By weighting each sample appropriately, we can compute a weighted average which serves as an
unbiased estimate of the total.
The weights are chosen to compensate for the non-uniform probabilities of visiting each room.
<p>
When we randomly choose a room and visit it via a "T" command, each room had an equal chance of
being chosen; we give this sample a weight of 1.
When we visit a room via a "W" command, each room did not have an equal chance of being visited.
We need to calculate weights for these samples, such that the expected weight for each room (the
probability of visiting that room via a "W" command, multiplied by the expected weight we assign
for such visits) is $$$1/N$$$.  This will give our final estimate the correct expected value.
<p>
Consider a sample where we were previously in a room $$$R_1$$$ with degree $$$A$$$, and then we
issued a "W" command and walked into a room $$$R_2$$$ with degree $$$B$$$.
The probability of us being in $$$R_1$$$ after the last "T" command was $$$1/N$$$.
The probability of following the passage to $$$R_2$$$ was $$$1/A$$$, because $$$R_1$$$ had $$$A$$$
passages connected to it.
So the overall probability was $$$1/(AN)$$$.  We assign this sample the weight $$$A/B$$$, so that
the contribution to the expected weight for room $$$R_2$$$ is $$$1/(BN)$$$.
After we sum over all $$$B$$$ ways we could arrive at $$$R_2$$$, we get a total expected weight of
$$$1/N$$$ for $$$R_2$$$, as required.
<p>
As an example, consider the following interaction:
<pre>
T 1
1 1
W
3 2
T 2
2 1
W
3 2
T 3
3 2
W
1 1
</pre>
We get samples of degrees $$$1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1$$$ with weights $$$1, 1/2, 1, 1/2, 1, 2$$$, and the
weighted average degree is $$$8/6$$$.
