Google Code Jam 2012 has begun, and our contestants have made a huge showing!  We have 15692 qualifiers, out of 20613 people who downloaded at least one input.  We had contestants representing 149 different regions of the world, using 73 programming languages.  All those numbers are records for us!

This year marked a change to our rules: before, every problem had to have one Small input and one Large input.  This year we led off with a problem that had only a Small input, and we might make other problems that are unusual in that way as the contest goes on.
