The online rounds for Google Code Jam 2012 are over, and we have our finalists!  They represent twelve different countries, and we'll be seeing a mix of old faces and new ones at our World Finals in New York City.  Our last two champions, Egor and rng..58, have qualified for the finals once more, and rng..58 will have a chance to defend his title.

<p>
Every problem was solved by someone, though only misof cracked D-large&mdash;a bold move, and reminiscent of rng..58's victory in 2011, since without the problem he wouldn't have advanced.  Solving A, C and D-small proved to be enough for most contestants, but a simple A-small led to more than a few wrong answers on A-large that knocked their submitters out of a shot at the finals.

<p>
Solving Problem B ended up being a bad choice strategically for a lot of people.  It was useful only to five of our finalists, and only in combination with C-small (without C-large).  It's very hard to judge what score will get you past the cutoff, both before and during a contest: the top contestant with A, B and D-small ended up in 32nd place, very close indeed to a berth in the finals.
