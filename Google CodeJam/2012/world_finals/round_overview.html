The final round of Google Code Jam 2012 was hard-fought throughout, and suspenseful at its end.  In a round where contestants were faced with two medium-difficulty problems and three very tough ones, the careful choice of which problems to attack was vital.

<p>
The contest for the highest ranks would come down to the very end.  Six of the top eight contestants would make submissions in the last ten minutes of the four-hour contest, and three of them would earn points off of those submissions.  At the end of the round, the scoreboard was as clear as mud: most of the points would come from Large submissions, and over ten of those would prove to be wrong.

The dust settled on a close scoreboard, whose final ordering came down to the problems contestants chose to solve and to the time it took them.  In third place was Slovakia's <b>misof</b>, who solved C and earned partial points for D and E.  In second, with his final submission to D coming seven minutes before the end of the contest, was the USA's <b>neal.wu</b>.  The winner, with the same problems and a time nearly an hour and a half faster, was Poland's <b>meret</b>.  He claims the title of Code Jam Champion, as well as a cool $10,000.

<p>
That's it for Google Code Jam 2012!  With that exciting sendoff, we're really looking forward to seeing you all again in 2013.
