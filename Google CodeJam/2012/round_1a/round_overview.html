<p>
Round 1A had two fairly approachable problems and one quite difficult problem.  Solving the first two problems within two hours and fifteen minutes was sufficient to advance.
</p>

<p>
Problem A was a straightforward simulation with probabilities.  A greedy algorithm can be used for Problem B.
</p>

<p>
Problem C was a constraint satisfaction problem, and was quite challenging to implement in time.  Only 22 people solved the large input.
</p>

<p>
SnapDragon got first place, completing problems A and B in 15 minutes each and problem C in 45 minutes.  He was followed by pieguy, dzhulgakov, squark, wata, Plagapong, and omeometo all finishing within two hours.
