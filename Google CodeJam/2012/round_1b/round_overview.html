Round 1B featured a tough implementation problem, a tough algorithmic problem, and a theoretically easy problem that proved the devil is sometimes in the details.  A large number of contestants managed to solve C-small and all of A; advancing required doing that within an hour, nineteen minutes and twenty-seven seconds.  Of course, contestants who weren't that quick off the mark could solve another problem to get ahead!

The simplest solution for Problem A needed a binary search, but a high failure rate showed that there were some tough details.  Problem B took Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs, plus some adaptation to deal with staying in one place for some time.  Problem C was a nifty problem that required some mathematical insight, with the most straightforward solution taking advantage of the birthday "paradox".

Belarusian wunderkind Gennady Korotkevich, or a clever impostor making use of his name, had enough points to qualify after 11 minutes, and finished solving the whole set after only 54 minutes, 11 seconds -- a feat that only 50 people could accomplish given the full 2.5 hours.  South Africa's bmerry and Canada's hansonw1 rounded out the top 3 over the course of the next 15 minutes.
