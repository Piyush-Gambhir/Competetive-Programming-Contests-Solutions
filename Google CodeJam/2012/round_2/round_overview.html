Round 2 whittled down our field from 3000 to 500 contestants with a combination of very challenging problems.  A theme in this round was the freedom to choose one of several ways to solve most of the problems we posed.
</p>
<p>
We began the round with a graph traversal problem that required one of a few possible insights to make it fast enough for the large input. This didn't stop 1630 of our contestants, though.

<p>
Aerobics is one of the problems that can be solved in very many ways, from rather grueling circle geometry to a nifty randomized solution requiring very little code.  Next came Mountain View, an ad-hoc problem which required contestants to re-create an input that would match the provided output.
</p>
<p>
Finally came Descending in the Dark, a very challenging problem in which many contestants succumbed to the temptation of trying a randomized or heuristic solution.  No one managed to solve the Large version of it, which was a very challenging DP!
