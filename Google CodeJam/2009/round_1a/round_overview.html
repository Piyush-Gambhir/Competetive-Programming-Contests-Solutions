Round 1A was the first round of Code Jam 2009 in which contestants competed simultaneously; and what a job they did!  2499 contestants submitted at least one attempt, using a total of 25 different languages and solving a total of 3543 inputs.  </p>
<p>
Problems A-large, B and C were all tough, and solving A-small alone in the first 45 minutes was enough to allow several contestants to advance.  Only 64 contestants successfully solved every problem in this tough set.  Congratulations to them, and to the top 1000, who advanced to Round 2!
