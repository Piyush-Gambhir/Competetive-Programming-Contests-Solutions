<p>Code Jam contestants never cease to surprise us, and their performance on this round was no exception.  Our tough implementation problem proved to be so tough that only 10% more people solved it than our tough algorithmic problem; and so many people were familiar with the theorems needed for Problem C that 362 of you breezed right through it.  Meanwhile Russia and East Asia dominated the top 10, with 9 out of the 10 top spots.  But with all else said and done, first place was no surprise to anyone: ACRush, 2008 Code Jam Champion, finished all four problems less than halfway through the competition, and almost 30 minutes faster than everyone else.

<p>Congratulations to the top 500 competitors, who will win a Code Jam t-shirt and advance to the next round!
