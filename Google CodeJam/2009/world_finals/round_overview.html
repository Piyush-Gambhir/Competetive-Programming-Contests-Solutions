The problem set was geometry-heavy, with three of the six problems requiring at least some computational geometry. Dynamic programming and probability made notable appearances as well.

<p>
Unusually, the round started with four different people solving four different problems (A, B, C and D). Most contestants quickly realized that E and F were much more difficult than the first four and left them to the end. ACRush ended up being the only one to solve problem F correctly. Vitaliy and dzhulgakov were the only two contestants to solve problem E and finished in 7th and 5th place respectively.
