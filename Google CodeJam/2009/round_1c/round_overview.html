In the last match of Round 1, the competition was as exciting as the first two.
</p>
<p> Interestingly, when the author created the first problem with a nice story, he did not notice that it actually  was a mixture of flavors from the first problems (Multi-base Happiness and The Next Number) from the other two matches. The second problem turns out to be a simple exercise in geometry. And the third one, standard dynamic programming.

<p>
183 people enjoyed full scores, while 2337 contestants has at least one correct submission. As in Round 1B, solving all three small inputs correctly was not sufficient to advance.

We hope the problems were educational and pleasant, and all of you had fun.
