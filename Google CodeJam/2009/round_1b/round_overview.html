Round 1B had easier problems, but it was not easy to qualify from. ACRush, the Code Jam 2008 Champion, finished all the problems in less than 45 minutes.
Solving problem B alone was not enough to qualify.

<p>
Problem A was not the favorite choice of the contestants, probably because of the long statement, although it was mostly about parsing. Problem B was easier to implement, but it required a little more thinking. Problem C needed some optimizations and was the last one to be implemented by most of the contestants.
<p>
63 people got 100 points, just one less than Round 1A. 3 of them submitted in the last minute.<br/>
Congratulations to all the people that qualified for Round 2!
