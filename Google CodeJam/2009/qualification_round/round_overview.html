<p>This was the first round of Google Code Jam 2009, and what an exciting round it was!  8600 people solved at least one problem, and about 7830 of those people solved a problem fully and got to advance to Round 1.  2420 people solved all three problems, and 3080 were properly welcomed to Code Jam.</p>
<p>The round was marred by an outage early on: a nearly two-hour period in which contestants would often get error messages when they tried to download an input.  To make up for that we extended the round by two hours, and offer our sincerest apologies to everyone affected.</p>
<p>Over 10,000 contestants, representing 111 countries, used 40 languages to solve the problems.  We hope you enjoyed the problems, and we look forward to seeing 7830 of you in Round 1!</p>
