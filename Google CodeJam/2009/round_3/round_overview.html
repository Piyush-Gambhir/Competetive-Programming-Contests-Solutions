This round featured some of the toughest problems we could come up with.  Of the four we posed, only one was a somewhat "standard" problem in any sense; the others all required ingenuity or insight of some sort.  All the problems were solved, though only barely; KOTEHOK, the only contestant to solve D-large, didn't have time to solve enough other problems to make it into the top 25.

For the judges, this was by far the most fun round to watch.  bmerry, a familiar figure at the top of the scoreboard, took the lead with half an hour to go, and held onto it.  ACRush, who won last year's competition and finished Round 2 with more than half the time to spare, got off to a slow start: he was briefly out of the top 25 before roaring into 5th place 2 hours in and holding on to claim his spot in the final.  And, of course, we love to see all of the different colours on the scoreboard: if they can all make it, this year's finalists will represent 15 different countries.

Congratulations to everyone who made it this far, and special congratulations to the top 25, who win a trip to Mountain View, California and a chance to compete in the Google Code Jam 2009 World Finals!
