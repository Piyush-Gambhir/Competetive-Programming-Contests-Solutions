Round 1A was our biggest non-Qualification round ever, with 6685 contestants who downloaded at least one input. Contestants faced three challenging problems: <i>Charging Chaos</i> was not a very hard problem, but the problem limits were a little bit misleading for some of the contestants, so they overrated the problem, and <b>41%</b> of attempts on the Large input failed as a consequence. <i>Full Binary Tree</i> was a directly described problem, could be solved with a greedy approach for depth-first-traversal algorithm, and unlike problem A, only <b>13%</b> of the Large input attempts failed for this problem.
</p>
<p>
The toughest problem of all was the non-traditional <i>Proper Shuffle</i> (same style as last year's Good Luck problem). The problem required some knowledge of classifiers and probability, and gave contestants the opportunity to retry (since it was just one small input set). It didn't help most of them, though: <b>85%</b> of the people who attempted the problem got it wrong.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, <b>54%</b> of our contestants solved something, and 198 people got <i>everything</i> right (That is really a huge number!).
<p>
We hope everybody enjoyed the round! Congratulations to the Top 1000, who have now made it to Round 2; and to everyone else, we'll see you in 1B and 1C!
