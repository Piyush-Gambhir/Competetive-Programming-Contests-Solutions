<p>Round 1B was one of the biggest non-qualification rounds so far, with <b>8268</b> contestants who downloaded at least one input. Contestants faced three challenging problems: <i>The Repeater</i> was the easiest problem, where some of the contestants got stuck for some time to trying to see the pattern and get the intuition for the problem, and <b>41%</b> of attempts on the large input failed. <i>New Lottery Game</i> was a standard Dynamic Programming problem, most of the contestants used DP to solve this problem. There is another approach which is discussed in the analysis. For New Lottery Game, <b>74%</b> of attempts on the large input failed. The toughest problem of all was <i>The Bored Traveling Salesman</i> where even its small input could not be implemented easily compared to other problems. Therefore only <b>700</b> contestants got it “Correct!” while about <b>36%</b> of attempts on the large input failed.</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, <b>89%</b> of the contestants solved at least one input (small or large), and <b>129</b> people got everything right.
