Google Code Jam 2014 is off and running! We have 20,595 advancers out of 25,462 people who correctly solved at least one input, and 49,066 registrants. People correctly solved problems from 165 different regions of the world, using 88 different programming languages. All those numbers are records for us!

We opened with a magic trick, and a game about gathering cookies, both of which had solutions that were straightforward -- at least in principle. Next came Minesweeper Master, which had an astonishingly low success rate: under 50% of people who thought they had solved it eventually did; and of our 25 fastest finishers in the round, 11 of them got it wrong on the first try. Last came Deceitful War, a problem that was harder to understand but easier to solve, which asked you to get inside the heads of both an honest game player and a dishonest one.

There are three more rounds to go before the Finals, and we are just getting started. We hope to see all the advancers in the First Rounds!
