<p>
<b>Gennady Korotkevich</b> is the 2014 Code Jam champion!
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YxYV6-9Bw" target="_blank">2014 Google Code Jam World Final</a> was hosted in Los Angeles, and our finalists this year came from all over the world: Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, Poland, South Korea, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. We had 26 finalists, including our defending champion Ivan Miatselski (<b>mystic</b>).
</p>

<p>
There were six problems, and it was extremely challenging to solve them all in the four hours the finalists had. To win the prestigious grand prize, the contestants had to be strategic in deciding which problems they were going to try.
</p>

<p>
There was a broad range of difficulty in this year’s problems. The small input of Problem B was the easiest, and 25 finalists solved it. Besides that, most finalists managed to solve Problem A and B, as well as the small inputs of Problems C, D, and E. The large inputs of Problems C and D were harder, but were still solved by more than 10 finalists. The large inputs of Problem E and F proved to be the hardest: only our champion solved E, and nobody solved F (though our runner-up came close).
</p>

<p>
At the end of the round, if we only counted the guaranteed points from small inputs, <b>hos.lyric</b>, <b>eatmore</b>, and <b>mystic</b> would make up the top 3. However, most of the points in a contest like this one come from submissions on large inputs, and <b>eatmore</b>, <b>mystic</b>, and <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> had the highest potential number of points. But as we discovered when we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYX3sn3Q_DQ#t=21128" target="_blank">unveiled the results</a> of our testing in an increasingly tense room, not all of them got all the points they might have.
</p>

<p>
The final result: Third place went to China's Yuzhou Gu (<b>sevenkplus</b>), who beautifully solved all problems except for the large input of E, and Problem F. In second place was Russia's Evgeny Kapun (<b>eatmore</b>) whose final attack on the large input of F was not quite correct, but who solved F-small. The winner, with an almost perfect performance on all problems except F was Belarus’s Gennady Korotkevich (<b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b>). This was Gennady's first Code Jam final, but only because he was too young in previous years: he first would have qualified in 2010, at the age of 14. Gennady has earned the title of Code Jam Champion, receiving a prize of $15,000 and a guaranteed ticket to the finals to defend his title next year!

You can see who solved what, when, and how the other contestants fared on the full scoreboard.

<p>
This year, we did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYX3sn3Q_DQ#t=445" target="_blank">live broadcast</a> of the whole contest on YouTube, which you can watch if you have an unusually high level of passion for the subject. It also contains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYX3sn3Q_DQ#t=18681" target="_blank">brief explanations of how to solve the problems</a> at the end, in case you're interested in hearing the solutions explained in a different way.
</p>

<p>
That's it for Google Code Jam 2014!  With a record-breaking number of participants and an exciting final, we look forward to seeing you all again soon!
