  Let's go over the varied set of problems for Round 1C. An <i>Overexcited Fan</i> had
  to get to an elusive celebrity cat to take a photo before their tour was over.
  Lovers of unusual problems were over the moon with <i>Overrandomized</i>,
  which was all about focusing on the right patterns in the data. Finally,
  <i>Oversized Pancake Choppers</i> was among the more difficult pancake
  problems we've ever posed; its name is an overt reference to problems in two

  With 1C done, the set of Round 1s is over. Hopefully they weren't overly
  difficult to the point of being overwhelming.

  Our first problem had a more straightforward solution than usual, involving
  simulation. The other two problems were hard enough that only two people solved
  the full set in under an hour: <b>Rafbill</b> with a penalty time of 35:06, and
  <b>maroon</b> only four seconds behind that at 35:10. After that, there was a
  gap until <b>spencercompton</b>, <b>Lutyj</b>, and <b>fedoseev.timofey</b> came
  in just past the 1 hour mark, with penalty times of 1:00:45, 1:03:37, and
  1:04:39, respectively. This time, there were just over 50 perfect scores out of
  over 10000 contestants who submitted. Almost 90% of contestants fully solved the
  first problem and got their picture with Peppurr!
</p><p>
  As usual, we will take some time to review the results, but tentatively, a
  score of 58, achieved fast enough, is good enough to advance. With so many
  test sets in this round (9, which was a record for a Round 1), there were
  many paths to a successful result.

  If you are not among the 1500 advancing from Round 1C, or the 3000 who
  already advanced from Rounds 1A and 1B, your journey is unfortunately over
  for this year... but we hope that you enjoyed the problems and will continue
  to <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive" target="_blank">practice</a>
  for next year's contest. You can also give
  <a href="http://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart" target="_blank">Kick Start</a>
  a try for the rest of this year. For those of you who did advance, we will
  see you in Round 2 in two weeks for the usual shot at a T-shirt and further
  Code Jam glory!
