<p>
  This was Code Jam's first-ever five-problem Qualification Round! Our easiest
  and hardest problems, <i>Vestigium</i> and <i>Indicium</i>, were both about
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)" target="_blank">traces</a>
  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square" target="_blank">Latin squares</a>
  (and both of their names roughly mean "trace" in Latin). <i>Vestigium</i>
  was an implementation problem; <i>Indicium</i> was more daunting, but could
  be solved in various ways from case work to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory)#Matching_in_bipartite_graphs" target="_blank">bipartite matching</a>.
  Of the middle three problems, <i>Nesting Depth</i> and
  <i>Parenting Partnering Returns</i> were tractable options for scoring enough
  points to advance, and <i>ESAb ATAd</i> was a difficult interactive problem
  (a sequel to last year's
  <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051705/" target="_blank">Dat Bae</a>
  problem) with a satisfying solution.
</p><p>
  Only 1 minute and 53 seconds into the round, <b>arknave</b> submitted the
  first correct solution of Code Jam 2020! And it didn't even take an hour for
  <b>xiaowuc1</b>, a legendarily fast Qual Round solver, to earn a perfect
  score. <b>cki86201</b> and <b>Benq</b> followed with their own perfect scores
  to claim second and third place, and <b>Golovanov399</b> and <b>Snuke</b>
  rounded out the top 5 that managed a perfect score within the first 2 hours.
  Despite the difficulty of the last two problems, 340 users earned a perfect
  score!
</p><p>
  We had over 96000 registrants, 44434
  (<a href="http://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051705" target="_blank">22222 + 22212</a>)
  of whom submitted at least one attempt, and 40697 of whom earned at least one
  point. Over 30000 contestants qualified for the Round 1s by scoring 30 points
  or more. All of these numbers are records for Code Jam! Just like last year,
  we were happy to see submissions in each of our supported languages.
</p><p>
  Thank you for joining us for another Qual Round, and we'll see many of you
  again in Round 1A in a week. (Remember that you can keep trying Round 1s
  as long as you have not already advanced to Round 2.) If you did not make it
  to Round 1 this time, we strongly encourage you to try again in 2021, since
  these things take time and practice! In either case, one way to train is to
  compete in
  <a href="http://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart" target="_blank">Kick Start</a>
  rounds throughout the year...
