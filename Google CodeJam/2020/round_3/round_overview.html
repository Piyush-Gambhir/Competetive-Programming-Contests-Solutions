  Our first problem in Round 3, <i>Naming Compromise</i>, could be solved by
  finding the right way to extract information from a well-known algorithm. If
  you've been looking for a way to name a baby, and you don't mind potentially
  ending up with a very strange string of letters, our method might be right
  for you! The next problem, <i>Thermometers</i>, represented a big step up in
  difficulty, but it was tractable once you wrapped your head around the
  circular island presented in the problem.
</p><p>
  The remaining two problems, <i>Pen Testing</i> and <i>Recalculating</i>,
  were different beasts entirely! Even a very seasoned competitive programmer
  might take hours to solve just one of them. Both were worth the same amount,
  so many contestants probably surmised that either one (plus the first two
  problems) could potentially serve as a pathway to the World Finals. It was a
  choice between creative and perhaps risky experimentation in Pen Testing, and
  finding the right setup and data structures for a tricky geometric situation
  in Recalculating.
</p><p>
  As we expected, we got many solves of Naming Compromise early on, and solutions
  to Thermometers trickled in slowly but steadily. A few contestants picked off
  earlier test sets of Pen Testing and Recalculating. At the 1:34 mark,
  <b>saketh.are</b> became the first contestant to fully solve Pen Testing.
  Not long after that, at 1:45, <b>Dlougach</b> submitted the first full solution
  to Recalculating. Everything had been solved at least once, and the race was on
  to cobble together enough points to make the top 25!
</p><p>
  <b>Benq</b> leapt to 70 points at 2:04, but our defending
  champion <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> sent a burst of submissions just
  a few minutes later, and reached an even more impressive total of 85.
  Surpassing that would have required solving the full set, and <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b>
  did indeed take first in the end, followed
  by <b>Benq</b>, <b>ecnerwala</b>, <b>peehs_moorhsum</b>, and <b>gs12117</b>
  (taking 5th with a last-minute submission!) There were various ways to advance,
  but it took more than the first two problems. Our contestants' overall performance
  was even stronger than we had predicted &mdash; you find new ways to impress us
  every year!
</p><p>
  In two months, our finalists will face off in our first-ever Virtual World
  Finals! We will confirm the results soon and will reach out to finalists with
  more info. Whether or not you advanced, you'll still be able to
  show off your Code Jam 2020 shirt to all your friends around the world. In the
  meantime, there's a

  round to satisfy your appetite for problems.
