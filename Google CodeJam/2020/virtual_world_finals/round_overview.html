  We know the Code Jam 2020 World Finals were a different experience, but the
  problems themselves were as challenging as usual! The first one,
  <i>Pack the Slopes</i>, was worth fewer points and could be solved with the
  right applications of some evergreen techniques. The other four were all
  worth the same (larger) amount of points, so contestants had to make tactical
  decisions based on their own strengths and preferences. Would they try the
  insight-based <i>Adjacent and Consecutive</i>, the implementation-heavy
  <i>Hexacoin Jam</i>, the tricky geometric <i>Musical Cords</i>, or the
  elegantly satisfying graph-based <i>Replace All</i>? Also, which Test Set
  1s were the lowest-hanging fruit?
</p><p>
  Only 13 minutes in, <b>Benq</b> submitted the first correct full solution,
  which was for Pack the Slopes. After that, it took another hour for one of the
  other problems to be solved (Replace All, by <b>ecnerwala</b> and then
  <b>yutaka1999</b>). <b>ecnerwala</b> was the first to break the 100 point
  barrier, around two and a half hours into the contest, and <b>ksun48</b>
  reached the same point total about 15 minutes later.
</p><p>
  The top of the board was quiet for a while, but then at 3:11,
  <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> made several submissions and leapt to 173 points,
  lacking only the second test set of Musical Cords. The other contestants
  didn't know the true results, of course, and there was a chance that someone
  could have overtaken him... but nobody did, and he became our seven-time
  Code Jam champion! What an impressive streak &mdash; our hats are off to
  you. In second, third, and fourth, all with 131 points, were <b>ksun48</b>
  (3:30:36), <b>ecnerwala</b> (3:55:58), and <b>scottwu</b> (4:13:58) &mdash;
  also excellent performances!
