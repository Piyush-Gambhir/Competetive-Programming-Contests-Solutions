<p>
  Round 2 began with our second pancake problem of 2020:
  <i>Incremental House of Pancakes</i>. Unlike in Round 1C, you didn't need to
  do any slicing, but this was tough for a first problem in Round 2, and
  careful coding was needed. Next came <i>Security Update</i>, which required
  you to think through the details of an ordering algorithm on a graph.
  The last two problems were even tougher! <i>Wormhole in One</i> asked you to
  play some space golf in which the ball could travel between connected holes.
  <i>Emacs++</i> was another problem in our series of
  <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000201bf3" target="_blank">riffs</a>
  on programming languages and editors. We just might create a Vim++ or C++++
  problem eventually...
</p><p>
  Our first fully correct solution to a problem didn't come in until just
  after the 10 minute mark, and it took around an hour to see our first full
  solve of every problem except Emacs++. Shortly before the two-hour mark,
  we got our first scores of 77, missing only Test Set 2 of Emacs++. The only
  perfect score came in within the last five minutes in the contest, from
  <b>Benq</b>, who won the round! The next four, all with 77 points, were
  <b>imeimi</b>, <b>sevenkplus</b>, <b>bmerry</b>, and <b>scottwu</b>. 22
  contestants solved at least one test set of the fearsome Emacs++, and
  <b>Benq</b> and <b>CCCiq</b> were the only contestants to fully solve it.
</p><p>
  Over 4000 of our 4500 qualified contestants participated in the round!
  As usual, please bear with us as we review the results, but the top 1000
  scorers in this round win this year's Code Jam T-shirt and advance to
  Round 3! Advancers have three weeks
  to <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive" target="_blank">practice</a>...
  but even if you didn't advance, please remember that competing in Round 2 is
  itself a noteworthy accomplishment.
  We'll also note that there's a
  <a href="http://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart" target="_blank">Kick Start</a>
  round coming up
  <a href="http://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/schedule" target="_blank"><i>very</i> soon</a>!
