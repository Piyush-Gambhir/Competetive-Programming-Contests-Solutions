  This year, Round 1B jumped right into the <i>Expogo</i> problem, which had a
  pleasing deterministic solution. <i>Blindfolded Bullseye</i> was interactive
  and involved geometry; arriving at a correct algorithm probably required
  drawing some pictures and experimenting bravely! The card-shuffling
  <i>Join the Ranks</i> had a constructive solution, but one that wasn't easy
  to find, and a brute-force approach was too slow even for Test Set 1 without
  an insight.

  This was a more time-consuming set of problems than Round 1A's set, and we
  didn't see our first perfect score until about an hour into the round.
  <b>jiry_2</b> was in the lead for much of the first hour, and was the first
  to solve every problem, but <b>mnbmvar</b> swooped in with a penalty time of
  1:04:30, and <b>jiry_2</b>'s penalty time ended up being slightly larger, at
  1:07:08. <b>isaf27</b> came in third with 1:08:38, and then
  <b>Marcin.Smulewicz</b> and <b>duality</b> were not far behind in fourth and
  fifth. By the end of the contest, there were almost 90 perfect scores.
</p><p>
  Once again, we had a five-digit number of contestants on the scoreboard.
  Tentatively, the advancement cutoff is 34 points plus a small enough
  penalty time. It wasn't quite enough to solve just Expogo! We saw quite a
  few pickups of the first Blindfolded Bullseye set; the first Join the Ranks
  set, on the other hand, was tougher to snag.

  Round 1C is two weeks from now, so you will have some extra time to
  <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive" target="_blank">practice</a>
  if that round will be your last chance to advance. Good luck, and next time
  you play darts, remember to flush your buffer between throws!
