  Round 1A was the second of three weekend contests in a row! This time, we
  opened with <i>Pattern Matching</i>, which was not as difficult as it
  may have initially seemed. <i>Pascal Walk</i> was an ad hoc problem that
  could be solved via various graph searching strategies, or with a more
  "mathy" insight. <i>Square Dance</i> required some thought about data
  structures. We hope there was something for everyone!
</p><p>
  <b>Benq</b> took a lead early on by solving the first and last problems in
  under 20 minutes, but then our six-time defending champion
  <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> snagged first place with a perfect score only 33
  minutes and 19 seconds into the round! Next up was <b>vepifanov</b> at 43:01,
  followed by <b>ecnerwala</b>, <b>semiexp.</b>, and <b>Geothermal</b>.
</p><p>
  Almost 12000 contestants submitted attempts in this round! Pattern Matching
  got a lot of solves, but Pascal Walk was tougher, and many contestants never
  made it to Square Dance. Even so, there were over 400 perfect scores! The
  tentative cutoff for advancement to Round 2 from this round (top 1500) is 63
  points, plus a fast enough penalty time; that corresponds to solving the
  first two problems.
</p><p>
  As usual, we will aim to finalize the results well before next weekend's
  Round 1B. If you advanced in this round, you can relax until Round 2 in
  mid-May, but if not, you have two more chances coming up! Either way,
  consider practicing with some past problems from our
