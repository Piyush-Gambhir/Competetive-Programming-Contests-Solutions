Code Jam 2010 is off to a huge start! Despite the tougher-than-usual problems and a few technical glitches, more contestants than ever advanced to Round 1 this year (about 8523).  We also set records in participants who downloaded at least one input (12092), participating countries (125), and programming languages (53).

The problems were a mix of simulation, number theory and big integer arithmetic. Big integers made their first appearance in a Code Jam round as part of a problem with the foreboding name of "Fair Warning".
