This last sub-round of round 1 saw the largest number of contestants and the largest amount of controversy. Problem A was about permutations masquerading as a geometry problem. Problem B was a crazy twist on Binary Search. And Problem C was a combination of parsing, dynamic programming and clever trickery.

<i>Load Testing</i> turned out to be the most unusual problem. We received dozens of requests for additional hints and explanations of sample test cases. It was a challenge for the judges to explain the problem as clearly as possible while remaining fair to all contestants. If our responses seemed harsh and unhelpful at times, please know that we tried our best to remain as fair as possible. Perhaps the analysis of Problem B can help clear up any remaining confusion.
