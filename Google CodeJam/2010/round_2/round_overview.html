<p> Round 2 of the 2010 Google Code Jam was quite challenging - a big step up from some of the Round 1 problems!
</p>
<p>
Problem A was not too hard conceptually, but the unusual diamond shape required our contestants to design their own way of implementation, and this proved to be difficult. Problem B was a dynamic programming puzzle about the upcoming FIFA world cup that required viewing it in the right way to make progress... Fortunately, our contestants were very good at this! Problem C is a wonderful mathematical puzzle with a simple depth first search solution. Our last problem has deep roots in computational geometry, and it required tremendous implementation skill to get everything right during a timed contest. A big congratulations is due to <b>halyavin</b> and <b>bsod</b> for their correct solutions!
</p>
<p>
The top three contestants were <b>bmerry</b>, <b>ZhukovDmitry</b>, and <b>winger</b>, who all solved 3 and a half problems in around 2 hours. Congratulations to them, as well to all of the 500 advancers to Round 3. There is only one more round to go until the on-site finals in Dublin!
