The problems in Round 1A were a collection of simulation, dynamic programming and game theory. After we had selected problem B as the medium, David Arthur came up with a clever solution that was 256 times faster than the original solution, but we decided to keep the input limits as-is. You can see a description of both algorithms in the analysis write-up of problem B.
