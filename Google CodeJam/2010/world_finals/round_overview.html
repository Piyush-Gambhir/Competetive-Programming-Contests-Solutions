<p>
This was our most difficult round ever. Two problems, E and F, remained unsolved in the end -- a floating point geometry problem and a tricky backtracking problem.
</p>

<p>
marek.cygan put the first entry onto the scoreboard just under 14 minutes into the competition with a correct submission of B-small. The rest of the round was a turbulent race, with many re-orderings of the top 5.
</p>

<p>
For the first 47 minutes of the competition, two-time defending champion ACRush had no submissions. He seemed to be looking at the screen, writing something on paper, but not typing. At 47m13s, he submitted a correct solution to C-small and quickly followed that 3 minutes later with a correct submission to D-small, making his presence in the top 10 known to all.
</p>

<p>
By this point, it had become clear that B was the most tractable problem of the round. Every one of the top 10 finishers ended up solving B, D and A-small. Nine of the top ten contestants solved C. The top 5 spots ended up being decided based on A-large, E-small and F-small.
</p>

<p>
At the 2h28m mark, earl became the first contestant to crack open problem E. One minute later, ACRush solved E-small as well and moved into the top spot for the next four minutes, until Egor solved D and took the #1 spot away from ACRush.
</p>

<p>
Egor ended up winning the title of Code Jam 2010 Champion with a definitive 11-point lead over 2nd-placed krijgertje. Burunduk1 took 3rd place, having been the only contestant to solve F-small correctly, which gave him a 6-point lead over ACRush, who finished in 4th. In 5th was marek.cygan, with B, C, D and A-small.
</p>

<p>
The last few minutes of the round saw a flurry of 11 submissions from ACRush on F-small, all incorrect. In total, 6 contestants solved E-small, but none of their solutions could pass E-large, which required one to detect and short-circuit loops in the ninja's rope. Although Egor and Eryx attempted E-large during the last minute, both of their solutions timed out.

<p>
Congratulations to all of the competitors. We hope to see you back next year.
