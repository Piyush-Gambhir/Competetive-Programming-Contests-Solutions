Round 3 was definitely the most difficult round of this year's Code Jam so far. Only the top 25 advanced to the Finals, and the problems were hellishly hard. Last year's winner, ACRush, struggled to stay in the top 25 after an incorrect submission of his B-large. Of course, none of the contestants knew that his submission was incorrect, as he stayed in the top spot on the scoreboard until the end of the round, when he dropped down to 24th place.

The last 20 minutes of the contest were a race among RAVEman, Gennady.Korotkevich and Burunduk1 to finish their last remaining problems. nika, winger and pashka joined the race to first place, each having 78 points with 5 minutes to go. With less than one minute to go, winger pulled out ahead with a full 100 points -- a clear win. Amazingly, just a few seconds later, Burunduk1 and Eryx joined him, having solved their last remaining problems as well. Burunduk1 ended up winning the round with 2 incorrect submissions over winger's 3.

Congratulations to all participants, and good luck to the top 25, who will compete in person at the World Finals in Google's Dublin office.
