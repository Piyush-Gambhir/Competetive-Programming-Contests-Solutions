  Code Jam finally turned 18 this year &mdash; it's now eligible for the World Finals!
  To celebrate, the Qualification Round jammed out for 3 hours longer than usual, for
  the first-ever 30-hour round.
</p><p>
  For the second time, the Qualification Round had five problems, with the first
  one being tied to a follow-up problem. <i>Reversort</i> and <i>Reversort Engineering</i>
  both versed on investigating a quirky sorting algorithm and were inverses of each other
  in a sense. <i>Reversort</i> required careful coding only, but
  <i>Reversort Engineering</i> involved an insight and working out some math.
  <i>Moons and Umbrellas</i> featured an early appearance of Cody-Jamal with a problem that
  could be solved greedily. However, if you wanted to go for the extra credit, a completely
  different approach was needed. In case you haven't noticed, there was no way the extra
  credit could help you or prevent you from advancing, so it really was just extra.
</p><p>
  The last two problems were significantly harder to tackle, as usual. <i>Median Sort</i>
  was an interactive problem that required adapting your knowledge of sorting algorithms and
  possibly putting information theory to work. Finally, <i>Cheating Detection</i>
  was an unusual problem, and not only because we don't do cheating detection for the
  Qualification Round. There were multiple ways to try to pinpoint the cheater, all based on
  finding the signal with the least noise.
</p><p>
  The first hour and a half of the contest had a scoreboard blackout due to a
  configuration mistake that was hard to pinpoint.
  This did not deter our participants from submitting and scoring lots of points during that time.
  When the scoreboard appeared, there were already thousands of contestants on it.
  One of them was <b>ksun48</b> who was the only competitor to achieve a perfect score within
  the first hour.
</p><p>
  In the end, 37398 contestants submitted something, with 33853 getting points.
  When the final results were revealed, 25961 scored at least 30 points and advanced
  to Round 1. 644 contestants went beyond and managed to score a perfect
  100 points, with 436 of them even getting to 101 due to the extra credit in
  Moons and Umbrellas.

  Thank you for joining us for another year of Code Jam! If you got at least 30
  points, congratulations, you have advanced! We will see you in any of the
  Round 1s, starting with Round 1A in two weeks. (You can keep participating in Round 1s
  until you advance to Round 2.) If you did not score enough points to
  get to Round 1 this time, we hope you'll join us in 2022!
  In the mean time, to improve your skills, you can practice with lots
  of old problems from our
