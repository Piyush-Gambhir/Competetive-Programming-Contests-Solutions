The final of the Round 1s of 2021, Round 1C, was quite
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day" target="_blank">laborious</a>.
The first problem, <i>Closest Picks</i>, was all about carefully picking your bets to
maximize your odds. It could be solved with a combination of simple probabilities and
a greedy strategy. <i>Roaring Years</i> took us on a history refresher course, but besides
the playful reference, it was all about properly splitting the space into disjoint cases,
and a solution followed straightforwardly from that. Finally, <i>Double or NOTing</i>
looked like a classical application of graph algorithms. However,
to get the full points you had to go a different route and think
carefully about binary representations.

The first perfect score took just over an hour, which was longer than both of the other Round 1s.
This gave <b>nqiiii</b> first place in the round. <b>daltao</b> and <b>square1001</b> came in
second and third place, respectively. Ultimately, 71 coders managed a perfect score.
Around 8000 coders submitted solutions in today's contest. The unofficial cutoff to advance to
Round 2 is 54 points.

This wraps up our Round 1s for the year. We'll finalize the results in the coming
days. In the meantime, you can keep improving your skills by practicing on this round's or
any past round's problems in the

</p><p>
If you placed in the top 1500, we will see you again in about 2 weeks as you join
3000 participants coming from the other Round 1s to compete in Round 2. Don't forget
to check your local time in the
<a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/schedule" target="_blank">schedule</a>
page. If you didn't earn enough points to advance, we hope you had a wonderful time
with our first 14 problems of the year. You are invited to follow along for the rest of the season,
and we hope to see you again next year!
