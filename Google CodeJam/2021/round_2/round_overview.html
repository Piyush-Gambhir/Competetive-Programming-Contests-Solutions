Code Jam's 2021 Round 2 was a different kind of challenge, with no easy points on the table.
The first problem, <i>Minimum Sort</i>, was interactive, which is always tricky. However,
it could be solved with one of the first algorithms most of us learned. <i>Matrygons</i>
had a geometry glazing but it was actually about arithmetic observations and
a recursion. As usual, the third problem is when things really heated up. Pancakes had a pretty
shy year, waiting until Round 2 to show up, and even then, they were
<i>Hidden Pancakes</i>. A classical problem of optimizing a dynamic programming
through combinatorics. The round's last problem had a more classical flavor. <i>Retiling</i>
was all about properly modeling the problem with graphs and then applying the right algorithm.

The scoreboard saw action pretty fast this time, with several successful submissions in the first
10 minutes and a few contestants getting the first two problems done within 15 minutes.
<b>Radewoosh</b> was the fastest to a perfect score at 36 minutes and 9 seconds, and with no
penalty attempts, which assured them the top position. <b>ksun48</b> followed less than 30 seconds
later for second place. <b>maroon</b> was the only other coder that had a perfect score with
under 40 minutes of penalty, rounding out the top 3. At the end, 3862 contestants got a positive
number of points and 284 of them finished with a perfect 100 points. The preliminary cutoff to
advance to Round 3 is 66 points and a low enough penalty.

The results will be reviewed in the coming days. Those who are in the top 1000 after the round is
marked finalized advance to the last elimination round of the year! There are 3 weeks to get
and/or stay in good shape until Round 3 (see the

For those of you for whom this round is the end of the season, we hope you are very proud of making
it this far. We are certainly amazed by how the problem solving skills of everyone keep getting
better every year. You can see a certificate highlighting
