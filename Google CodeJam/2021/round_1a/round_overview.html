Round 1A started with another problem about a strange sorting algorithm. However, solving
<i>Append Sort</i> was not at all about sorting. A greedy approach was needed instead.
There was a significant jump in difficulty to <i>Prime Time</i>, which had two accessible
test sets, but the full problem was quite challenging. It required some math work to be solved.
Finally, <i>Hacked Exam</i> was the odd problem of the round statement-wise.
Framed in the right way, however, it could be approached in typical competitive programming
fashion.

<b>Um_nik</b> was the first one to a perfect score, and that gave them the top position in
the final standings. <b>Marcin.Smulewicz</b> and <b>semiexp.</b> rounded out the top 3 with
only a few more minutes of penalty. In total, 49 people managed a perfect score.
More than 8200 people scored some points out of the more than 10000 that submitted a solution.

When the hidden results were revealed, the contestant in 1500th place had 54 points,
which is the unofficial cutoff for advancing. Come back once results are finalized
to see the final look of the scoreboard.

Congratulations to all advancers! If you did not advance, you have two more chances
in Round 1B and Round 1C. See the
