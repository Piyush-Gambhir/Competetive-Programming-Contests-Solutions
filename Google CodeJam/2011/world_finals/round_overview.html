The Final round turned out to be unusually difficult. Most contestants started with problem A and later realized that repeated simulation would work for E-small. Moving beyond that, however, proved to be a nearly impossible feat.

The winner, rng..58, ended up being the only contestant to solve the fiendishly difficult E-large. mystic took second place with B-small and D-small on top of A and E-small. meret came very close to taking the top spot, if not for a failed B-large (caused by a 32-bit int overflow). He finished in third.

Congratulations to the winners! We hope to see everybody next year. The 2012 finals will be held in New York City!
