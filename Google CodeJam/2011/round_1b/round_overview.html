Round 1B was clearly easier than 1A. Only 10 minutes after the start, submissions for A-small started pouring in. Gennady.Korotkevich took an early lead with a lightning fast submission of A-large. Fifteen minutes later, he followed it up with a correct solution to problem B, taking the first place back from rng..58, who had briefly held it by solving problem B first.

After a long silence, three nearly simultaneous submissions for C-small arrived from RAVEman, Gennady.Korotkevich and vepifanov at the 50-minute mark, putting the three contestants into a dead heat for a shot at the first place. Five minutes later, emaxx joined the race with a correct C-small. We spent the next ten minutes in anticipation.

<p>
At the one hour mark almost exactly, three new contestants took a leap to the top with correct submissions on C-large -- rng..58, pieguy and bsod.

<p>
When the round ended, almost half of the submissions to B-large turned out to be incorrect, possibly because of overflow errors. rng..58 retained his top spot with six flawless submissions, followed by Zhukov Dmitry and winger. In order to advance to round 2, it was not enough to have solved only problem A.

<p>
Good luck to the top 1000 in round 2. Everyone else will have one more chance to advance in round 1C.
