At the start of Round 3, a few contestants glanced at the picture of a polygon in problem A and immediately jumped to problem D instead. The first few submissions were brute force solutions to D-small. Problem A, however, turned out not to be as scary as it looked, and acrush took an early lead by solving it in under 10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
A large number of contestants chose to start with problem B instead, and omeometo went for problem C. For quite some time, he remained the only one to have solved C correctly.
</p>

<p>
At the 30 minute mark, nika, andrewzta, vepifanov, KennyHORROR, zyz915 and acrush held the top 6 spots with solutions to both A and B. Forty minutes into the contest, everyone in the top 25 had correctly solved two problems. No one had three yet, although winger had A and C instead of A and B, which held him in first place.
</p>

<p>
Just short of one hour into the competition, nika became the first contestant to solve three problems correctly. He had also already had D-small at that point, which gave him a commanding, 22-point lead over Gennady.Korotkevich, who was in second place despite a failed B-large. Of course, he probably did not know that at the time.
</p>

<p>
More and more solutions to problem C continued to come in, but with less than an hour left to go there were still no attempts on D-large. With 45 minutes left to go, the top 25 contestants all had 69 points, which meant having solved everything except for D-large, and there were still no attempts at the fiendishly difficult problem.
</p>

<p>
In the end, only linguo managed to solve D-large, earning him a well-deserved first place. He went with Python this time instead of choosing a more esoteric language.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations to the top 25. We hope to see you in Tokyo!
