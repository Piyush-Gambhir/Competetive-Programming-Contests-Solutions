Round 1C started off with hundreds of submissions to problem A. Soon after, solutions to C-small started pouring in. Many contestants noticed the low point value of C-small and solved it with a quick brute force solution.
</p>

<p>
At the 25 minute mark, solutions to problem B began appearing at the top of the scoreboard. Burunduk1 took the lead, followed by wangyongliang and anton.akhi.

Problem C-large proved to be very difficult. It was a choice between risking a time-out with BigInteger and risking overflow with int64. After more than 100 contestants had attempted C-large unsuccessfully, meshanya was the first to solve it, 52 minutes into the contest, but had yet to start on problem B.
</p>

<p>Burunduk1 followed a minute later with the second correct C-large and retook his first place. Ten minutes later, mystic solved C-large and grabbed second place. Soon after, yuhch123 submitted the 4th correct C-large (out of over 300 attempts by that point) and took 3rd.

<p>
The competition for top 1000 was fierce. The minimum score to advance ended up being 40, which meant solving at least problem A and both of the other smalls with at least 30 minutes left to go.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations to all 3000 advancers. Good luck in Round 2!
