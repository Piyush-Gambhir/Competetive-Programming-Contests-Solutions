Round 2 started off with a flurry of submissions to problem A. After that, half of the contestants chose to work on B; others started on C. austrin was the lone dissenter, solving the tricky D at the 28-minute mark. He was the only person on the scoreboard with a correct D-large for a long time.

By the end of the first hour of competition, two-time champion acrush took the lead for the first time in Code Jam 2011, with correct solutions to problems A, B and C. Ahyangyi and mystic followed him soon after, with their own error-free solutions to those problems. At that point, it was a race to see whether austrin could finish the rest of the problems before anybody else figured out a solution to D -- a tricky graph theory problem.

At the 1h7m mark, acrush submitted a correct solution to D-large, decisively taking first place. Ten minutes later, mystic and meret followed with correct solutions of their own, taking second and third place, respectively. austrin ended up solving the four problems in the order (D, B, C, A) and earning fourth place.
