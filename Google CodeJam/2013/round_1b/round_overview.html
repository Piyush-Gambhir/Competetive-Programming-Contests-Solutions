  <p>Round 1B attracted nearly 5000 participants fighting for the 1000 spots that gave qualification to Round 2. The first problem our contestants faced was game-based Osmos with a greedy solution; over 3500 contestants managed to figure it out. This was followed by Falling Diamonds, where you had to calculate the probability of getting a diamond; a significant number of contestants had a hard time with getting the small input right. See the analysis of the problem for our ideas on how to solve it!</p>

<p>The final problem of this round was Garbled Email, which was much more accessible than Round 1A's Good Luck, with over 200 successful submissions for the large. This required some insightful string manipulation to handle a huge dictionary we provided.</p>

<p>119 contestants managed to get a full score from this round, led by Indonesia's dolphinigle, who finished all the problems in a bit over an hour. To advance to Round 2 you needed either the large of one of the two more difficult problems, large of Osmos and the small of Falling Diamonds, or large of Osmos, small of Garbled Email, and a really impressive speed!</p>

<p>Congratulations to the top 1000, and we hope you enjoyed the problems in this round!</p>
