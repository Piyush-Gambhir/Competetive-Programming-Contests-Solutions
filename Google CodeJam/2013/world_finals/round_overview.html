<h3>Ivan Miatselski (mystic) earns the 2013 Champion title.</h3>

<p>
The problem set for the 2013 finals was nearly impossible to solve in its entirety. This meant that the contestants had to be strategic in deciding which problems they were going to try their hand at if they wanted a chance to win the grand prize. The point values for the problems were 25, 29, 39, 43, 64, making problem E “Let Me Tell You a Story” by far the most important. Strangely enough, it was the high point value that perhaps was the reason problem E went unsolved: many contestants mentioned after the finals that they assumed it to be too difficult because of the high point value, explaining why they didn’t try too hard to crack it.

However, problem C “X Marks the Spot” suddenly took its place as the toughest problem that was still solved. Geometry problems are always hard no matter how easy they look, and only <b>staniek</b> (winner of Round 1C), managed to deal with all its tricks correctly in almost two hours: he spent one hour before trying to submit, submitted an incorrect solution for C-small, then found a bug (he was drawing the border directly through a gold mine) and fixed it in 30 more minutes, and then spent another 20 minutes before getting the large input done. That put him in the prime position to win the grand prize, and the spectators were waiting for him to solve the problems that proved to be quite tractable for other contestants and jump into the first place - but he lost his best shot at victory when the clock ran out on his attempt to solve D-large.

That left the prizes up for grabs for people who were solving problems A, B and D. The eventual top three all managed to solve those three problems completely, and also solve one or two other smalls. In third place was Russia’s <b>winger</b>: but spending almost an hour and a half on D made it difficult for him to challenge the first two contestants. In second place was Ukraine’s <b>Vasyl</b>, who was actually the first to get all of A, B and D solved. The winner was Belarus’s <b>mystic</b>, who overtook <b>Vasyl</b> in the last hour of the contest by solving E-small about 10 minutes earlier than his Ukrainian opponent, and then cementing his first place with C-small. Having placed second in 2011, <b>mystic</b> has finally made the final step - congratulations to him, and to all finalists!
