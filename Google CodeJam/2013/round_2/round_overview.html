In this round, rng..58 took an early lead by solving problem B while most other contestants were working on A. Soon after, fellow Japanese contestants hos.lyric and komaki jumped to the top with problems B and C solved, also skipping problem A.

<p>
One hour into the contest, over 100 contestants had correctly solved problem A or B, with very few solutions for C, and no attempts on D. At that point, it looked as if solving both A and B might be enough to guarantee a ticket to round 3. In another half an hour, there were just over 20 correct solutions for problem C, but still no correct attempts for problem D, not even for D-small.

The top 3 spots remained unchanged for over an hour -- hos.lyric, Gennady.Korotkevich, and fanhqme -- each with problems A, B and C. This remained the case until the very last minute, when bmerry came in with an impressive solution for both parts of problem D, earning him the top spot on the scoreboard. He submitted his D-large solution with only 6 seconds left on the clock!
