Round 1A was our biggest non-Qualification round ever, with 6414 contestants who downloaded at least one input.  Contestants faced three challenging problems: Bullseye could be tricky and cause integer overflow without some careful attention (or the use of Python, or similar languages), and 62% of attempts on the Large input failed as a consequence.  Manage Your Energy gave contestants a similarly hard time, with a 60% failure rate: many people found their algorithms didn't run quickly enough to fill a calendar with 10,000 events.

<p>
The toughest problem of all was the non-traditional Good Luck.  The problem required some knowledge of probability, and gave contestants the opportunity to retry the second input set.  It didn't help most of them, though: <b>95%</b> of the people who attempted the problem got it wrong.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, though, an impressive 92% of our contestants solved something, and 23 people got <i>everything</i> right.
<p>
We hope everybody enjoyed the round!  Congratulations to the Top 1000, who have now made it to Round 2; and to everyone else, we'll see you in 1B and 1C!
