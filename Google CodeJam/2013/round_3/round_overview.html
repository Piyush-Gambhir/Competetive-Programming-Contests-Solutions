A few contestants started this round by quickly solving D-small. Soon after, mozeda took an early lead with the more clasic approach of solving problem A first. The other three problems turned out to be a lot more difficult. It wasn't until almost an hour into the contest when the first correct submission for C-large came in from team5. A few minutes later, Breakun became the first contestant to solve B-large. The first contestant to solve D-large was pieguy at the 1h20m mark.

At that point, it was clear that none of the problems was impossible, and the race was on for the coveted Onsite Finals spots. Eastern Europeans were dominating this round, with 10 of the top 10 spots and just over an hour left to go, when veteran SnapDragon broke into the top 3 with a correct C-large. Gennady.Korotkevich attempted B-large in the last few seconds of the round, but ran out of time. That didn't stop him from winning the round though.

Overall, this ended up being a very difficult round. Each of the top 25 contestants fully solved one problem other than A, but nobody managed to solve three full problems! Congratulations to the finalists. We hope to see you in London.
