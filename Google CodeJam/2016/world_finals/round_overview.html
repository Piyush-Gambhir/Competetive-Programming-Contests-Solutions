Our 2016 final round featured five problems instead of the typical six, but
they were a bit tougher on average than usual, and they were sufficient to keep
all of our contestants busy. Nobody solved all five, but each of the five was
solved at least once.
</p><p>
<i>Integeregex</i> was a relatively approachable but implementation-heavy
problem involving regular expressions and automata. <i>Family Hotel</i> and
<i>Gallery of Pillars</i> were challenging combinatorics and math/geometry
problems, respectively. <i>Map Reduce</i> was a graph problem that required
some tough but satisfying insights, and <i>Radioactive Islands</i> was an
unusual path optimization exercise that allowed several possible approaches.
</p><p>
kevinsogo jumped out to an impressive early lead with A, B, and C in just over
two hours. About 45 minutes after that, defending champion Gennady.Korotkevich
started to turn up the heat with an impressive flurry of solving that included
D, C-small, and B-large. Throughout most of the last hour, there were several
opportunities for another contestant to pass Gennady.Korotkevich, but he pulled
out of reach in the last 10 minutes with the first and only complete solution
to E. This left him just one dataset (C-large) shy of a perfect score, and he
took the championship for the third year in a row!
</p><p>
kevinsogo and EgorKulikov spent some time grappling with D and C, respectively,
but ultimately attained impressive scores of 120 and took the honors of second
and third place. semiexp. and rng..58 also distinguished themselves as the
first solvers of problems B and C, respectively. (EgorKulikov was the first to
solve A, and Gennady.Korotkevich had the first solutions for D and E.)

That wraps up our 2016 season! We hope you enjoyed participating, and we'll be
back again next year to serve up another selection of challenging and fun
problems!
