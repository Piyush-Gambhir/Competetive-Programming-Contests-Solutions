This year, we had 58,520 registrants, 27,170 contestants with at least one solved dataset on the scoreboard, and 1,710 contestants with perfect scores!
We had a full 27 hours of coding fun, with the first correct submission at 2
minutes and 15 seconds. For the fourth year in a row, xiaowuc1 had the first
correct submission of the Qualification Round! xiaowuc1 was also the third to a
perfect score (49:13), behind Lewin in first place (40:51) and Endagorion in
second place (47:47).

The first problem, Counting Sheep, was a relatively simple "try it and see"
implementation exercise. Revenge of the Pancakes playfully alluded to
Infinite House of Pancakes, a
harder pancake-related problem from last year's Qualification round, but
admitted a much simpler solution. Coin Jam was an unusual exercise in "mining"
for "coins" with certain properties... or easily constructing them outright,
if you found the right math trick! Finally, Fractiles was a more complex
problem about logic and information.

Congratulations to our 22,154 competitors who earned at least 30 points and
advanced to the Round 1 contests; we'll see you soon in Round 1A!
