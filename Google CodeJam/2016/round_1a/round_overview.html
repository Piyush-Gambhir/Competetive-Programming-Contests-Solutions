The first of our three Round 1s got off to a quick start: sourspinach submitted
the last of six datasets a mere 19 minutes and 31 seconds into the round!
sourspinach had a 4 minute penalty from an Incorrect Small submission, though,
and was passed by nika (21:06, no penalties) for first place. The fast pace
continued throughout the round.

<i>The Last Word</i> has a simple greedy approach. <i>Rank and File</i> becomes
quite simple if you have one key observation; of course, having that            
observation may not be so simple! <i>BFFs</i> is a more complex graph problem
that requires some thought and careful implementation; nonetheless, 1,055       
contestants successfully solved	all datasets correctly!
<p></p>
An impressive 10,047 competitors got at least one dataset right, which explains the huge number of perfect scores. To be in the top 1000, you needed a perfect score and a little bit of speed. However, there are two more chances to qualify for round 2!
</p><p>
Emails with the final verdict will go out soon, at least one day before Round 1B.
</p><p>
The top 1000 contestants in this round advance to Round 2. If you weren't in
the top 1000, you still have a chance to advance in Round 1B or Round 1C; see   
the schedule.
