Round 1B featured two problems with possible greedy approaches, <i>Getting
the Digits</i> and <i>Close Match</i>; the latter was much trickier to wrestle
with! <i>Technobabble</i> required bipartite matching for the Large; more
advanced techniques like this tend to show up as the contest goes on.
</p><p>
Two of our competitors in Round 1B, ikatanic and rng..58, accomplished a feat
that we've never seen before in Code Jam: by submitting their final correct
datasets at exactly the same time (37 minutes and 32 seconds into the contest,
with no penalties for wrong Smalls), they tied for first place! Congratulations
to our co-winners of this round.
</p><p>
Almost 8,000 contestants submitted at least one correct dataset, and there
were 324 perfect scores. To be in the top 1000, you needed at least 56 points
(which usually meant at least two Larges) plus some speed.
</p><p>
The top 1000 contestants in this round advance to Round 2 and Distributed
Round 1, joining the 1000 advancers from Round 1A. We will email official
results early next week. If you weren't in the top 1000 in Rounds 1A or 1B,
Round 1C will give you one more chance to advance; see the
schedule.
