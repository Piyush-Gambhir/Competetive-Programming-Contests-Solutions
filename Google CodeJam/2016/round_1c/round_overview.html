In another Code Jam first, all three of the problems in this round allowed
multiple answers per test case. <i>Senate Evacuation</i> was the easiest of the
trio; many greedy approaches were possible. The other two were tougher, and
even the Smalls required some insights on top of pure brute force.
<i>Slides!</i> gave you nearly free rein to construct a graph with certain
properties, and <i>Fashion Police</i> was set in New York, in a nod to our
upcoming World Finals venue.

Contestant artberryx grabbed the first place slot with six correct submissions in 38 minutes and 49 seconds, and there were 144 perfect scores. To advance, you needed at least 52 points and some speed. Contestants who didn't solve the Slides! large quickly enough had to contend with Fashion Police, a problem in which the tempting greedy solution doesn't work.
<p>
We'll see our 3000 advancers &mdash; 1000 each from Rounds 1A, 1B, and 1C
&mdash; in Round 2 and Distributed Round 1 on
May 28 and 29. If
you didn't advance in Round 1, thanks for participating, and we hope to see you
again in the 2017 contest!
