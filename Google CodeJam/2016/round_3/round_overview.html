In the last of our many online rounds, contestants faced four problems.
<i>Teaching Assistant</i> presents a somewhat complex situation, but
the problem has a simple greedy solution. <i>Forest University</i> poses
the challenge of uniformly sampling tree traversals, and can be solved
via simulation. <i>Rebel Against The Empire</i> is a 3D geometry / graph
problem with a potentially tricky implementation. Finally, <i>Go++</i>
is a "wild card" problem about concurrency; it has a surprisingly simple
answer, although it is tough to see it!

52 minutes into the contest, every dataset had been solved at least once;
contestants raced to solve the three toughest datasets (the Larges for
B, C, and D). apiad was first to 100 points on the scoreboard at 1:50:30,
but had C-large wrong. xyz111 had the first complete set of correct
submissions, but with enough penalties to push the total time to
2:42:09; nobody else registered a perfect score, though, so that record stood.
Go++ ultimately had more correct Large attempts than Rebel (perhaps in part
because its point value was higher), and so it turned out to be necessary to
solve it to make the top 25, although the cutoff line was <i>very</i> close
right up until the end.

Congratulations to everyone who made it this far and participated in
the round. 25 contestants plus our defending champion
(Gennady.Korotkevich) will head to New York to face off in this year's
Finals on
August 5.
