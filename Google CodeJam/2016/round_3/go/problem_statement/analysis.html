<h3>Code Jam 2016 - Round 3</h3><h1>Analysis: Go++</h1><h2>go++: Analysis</h2>
<p>
To make the analysis a tiny bit easier to follow, we'll typeset strings
(<b>B</b>, <b>G</b>, and output from the Go++ programs) in monospace font,
instructions from the first program in normal font, and instructions from the
second program with an underline.
</p><p>
First, let's try to figure out when the problem is impossible to solve. It's
clearly impossible when <b>B</b> is in <b>G</b>; that case is even in the
sample input. What about otherwise?
</p><p>
Surprisingly, <i>if </i><b>B</b><i> is not in </i><b>G</b><i>, the problem is
always solvable</i>.
</p><p>
To prove this, I'll construct two Go++ programs that, when run as described in
the problem statement, can produce <i>any</i> <b>L</b>-length string
<i>except</i> <b>B</b>. That sounds harder than making one that just produces
the strings in <b>G</b>, but sometimes, making the problem more difficult is a
great way to gain the insight you need to solve the original problem. For this
problem in particular, the set <b>G</b> is a red herring!
</p>
<h3>The first program</h3>
<p>
Given an input string <b>B</b>, construct the first program as follows:
<ol>
<li>Start with the inverse of every character of <b>B</b> (<code>0</code>
&#8614; 1, <code>1</code> &#8614; 0).</li>
<li>Add a ? instruction after every 0 or 1 instruction.</li>
</ol>
For instance, if <b>B</b> = <code>111</code>, which could appear on the Small
input, the first program is 0?0?0?. If <b>B</b> = <code>010</code>, which could
only appear on the Large input, the first program is 1?0?1?.
</p><p>
Why does this work? Notice that by default, this program generates the opposite
of <b>B</b>. In order to generate a different string, we need to override one
or more of the ? instructions; that is, the programs need to be interleaved
such that right before the ? from the first program, some other instruction
from the second program changes what it prints. For instance, given the first
program 1?0?1?, we can print <code>011</code> instead of <code>101</code> using
the second program <u>01</u>, if it's interleaved as follows:
1<u>0</u>?0<u>1</u>?1?. In order to print <b>B</b>, we need to override all
three ? instructions.
</p><p>
So how do we prevent that from happening? We write a second program that cannot
override all three ? instructions. Our solution differs for the Small and Large
inputs.
</p>
<h3>The second program (Small)</h3>
<p>
For the Small input, <b>B</b> is always a string of <code>1</code>s. That means
the first program is always 0?, repeated <b>L</b> times. For instance, if
<b>B</b> = <code>111</code>, the first program is 0?0?0?.
</p><p>
Our second program needs to be able to override any two of those ?
instructions; that way, we can print any output with up to two <code>1</code>s.
However, we can't override all three ? instructions, since that means our
program might print <b>B</b>. So we need a second program that contains
<b>L</b>-1 <u>1</u>s, but not <b>L</b> <u>1</u>s. The solution to this is
fairly simple: our second program simply consists of <u>1</u>, repeated
<b>L</b>-1 times. For instance, if <b>B</b> = <code>111</code>, the second
program is <u>11</u>.
</p>
<h3>The second program (Large)</h3>
<p>
To solve the problem for arbitrary <b>B</b>, we need a second program that,
when taken as a string, has every (<b>L</b>-1)-length string as a subsequence
(so we can print any string except <b>B</b>), but doesn't have <b>B</b> as a
subsequence. (Here, we use "subsequence" to mean any set of elements, ordered
as they appear in the original sequence; they need not be adjacent.) We'll
discuss how to produce such a program shortly.
</p><p>
Now, with our first program and this hypothetical second program, we can
produce any <b>L</b>-length string except <b>B</b>. That's because the second
program has every possible subsequence of length <b>L</b>-1, so we can override
up to <b>L</b>-1 of the ? instructions of the first program. However, we cannot
override all <b>L</b> of them to produce <b>B</b>, because the second program
doesn't have <b>B</b> as a subsequence.
</p><p>
There are many ways to generate the second program. This one won't produce the
shortest program, but it is perhaps the easiest to explain:
<ol>
<li>Start with a copy of <b>B</b>, excluding the last character.</li>
<li>Replace each character with a two-character sequence as follows:
<code>0</code> &#8614; <u>10</u>, <code>1</code> &#8614; <u>01</u>.</li>
</ol>
For instance, if <b>B</b> = <code>010</code>, the second program is
<u>1001</u>. The first <code>0</code> becomes <u>10</u>, the <code>1</code>
becomes <u>01</u>, and we ignore the last character of <b>B</b>.
</p><p>
We outlined the two requirements above for the second program to be valid:
<ul>
<li>The second program must have every (<b>L</b>-1)-length string as a
subsequence.</li>
<li>The second program must not contain <b>B</b> as a subsequence.</li>
</ul>
Now, we will show that the steps above give us a second program that satisfies
these requirements.
</p><p>
To get any (<b>L</b>-1)-length subsequence, split the second program into pairs
of adjacent instructions. Each pair contains a 0 and a 1, since that's how we
built the program. So we just pick one character from each pair, and we have
any (<b>L</b>-1)-length string!
</p><p>
Now, let's try to get <b>B</b> as a subsequence of our second program. Say
<b>B</b> = <code>010</code> and the second program is <u>1001</u>. In order to
get 010 as a subsequence, we start from finding the first 0 in <u>1001</u>,
which occurs at the second character. Next we find the first 1 after that,
which is the fourth character. The pattern continues: because of how we've
built the second program, we always go through two characters whenever we try
to find <b>B</b> as a subsequence. And because the second program only has
2<b>L</b>-2 characters, we can't find all of <b>B</b> as a subsequence.
Therefore, our second program is valid.
