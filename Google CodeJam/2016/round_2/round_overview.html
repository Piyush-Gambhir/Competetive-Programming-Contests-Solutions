Round 2 turned up the heat with some tougher problems. Even the easiest one,
<i>Rather Perplexing Showdown</i>, can be tough depending on how you approach
it. <i>Red Tape Committee</i> requires some standard dynamic programming
techniques and a perhaps counterintuitive insight about probability.
<i>The Gardener of Seville</i> is an unusual construction problem that is not
trivial to implement even when you know what to do, and <i>Freeform Factory</i>
is a tricky graph/matching problem.

The first hour of the contest saw many solves of A and B, and some correct answers to the
tougher larges trickled in. SnapDragon was the first to crack C-large, at 44:09. austrin
snagged the first D-large solution at 55:45, and had the only one until reigning champion Gennady.Korotkevich solved it at 1:11:07, jumping to the top of the scoreboard. For a while,
many contestants were one problem away from 100, but EgorKulikov reached it first with
a penalty time of 1:55:43. EgorKulikov had two wrong tries on one problem, so a tense 8
minutes passed in which another contestant could have jumped into first place, but this did
not happen and victory was secured. Ahyangyi, eatmore, and betaveros followed up with our
other three perfect scores.

Although the results are provisional until confirmation emails are sent, the top 500 required
at least 46 points (often all of A and B plus one other Small) plus some speed, and the top
1000 required 29 points (at least one Large, usually A) plus some speed.
Congratulations to the top 1000... wear your 2016 Code Jam T-shirt with pride!
The top 500 will join us in Round 3 to compete for one of 25 tickets to the
World Finals in New York in August! Even if you didn't advance or win a T-shirt
in this round, remember that DCJ Round 1 offers another chance at a T-shirt and
a trip to New York; it will take place on
May 29.
