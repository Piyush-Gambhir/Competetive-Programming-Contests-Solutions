  The last of our Round 1s began with <i>A Whole New Word</i>; for those
  of you who know the song "A Whole New World", good luck getting it out of
  your heads! <i>Lollipop Shop</i> was another interactive problem with a
  somewhat intuitive solution; it also might have gotten you thinking about a
  certain 1950s song. <i>Ant Stack</i> was much harder than either of the
  previous two problems, but still approachable with enough thought and
  patience. It was easy to underestimate the limits of the second test set
  and time out!

  This round was easier than 1B, and only 20 minutes into the contest, every
  problem had been solved by someone. <b>Eryx</b> was the first to snag a
  perfect score, after 35 minutes and 24 seconds. Full solutions to the first
  two problems generally sufficed to crack the top 1500.

  That concludes Round 1 of Code Jam 2018! We will see our 1500 advancers from
  Round 1C, along with the combined 3000 advancers from Rounds 1A and 1B, in
  Round 2 in two weeks. 1000 of them will emerge with T-shirts and places in
  Round 3 and the Distributed Code Jam Online Round. For those of you who did
  not make it through the Round 1s, we encourage you to try again next year.
  Even making it through the Qual Round and giving Round 1 your all is a
  significant achievement!
