  This year, rank 1000 in Round 2 became an especially important cutoff point
  &mdash; contestants had to place at least 1000th to earn advancement to Round
  3 and the Distributed Code Jam Online Round, as well as the 2018 Code Jam
  T-shirt. With 4500 eligible contestants, though, it wasn't going to be easy,
  and there were also four problems to contend with!
</p><p>
  We hope you warmed up with <i>Falling Balls</i>, which allowed for
  complicated constructions but was solvable with a straightforward greedy one.
  <i>Graceful Chainsaw Jugglers</i> and <i>Costume Change</i> required some
  original insights and some familiarity with typical techniques in the
  algorithmic toolbox like dynamic programming and matching. The graph problem
  <i>Gridception</i> was the toughest of the set; even once you saw the
  solution, there was plenty of implementation work left!
</p><p>
  Unlike many of our previous Round 2s, this set lacked a killer problem, and
  our awesome contestants racked up almost 250 perfect scores! Our four-time
  defending world champion <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> secured first place,
  solving all four problems in just over 40 minutes. <b>Um_nik</b> and
  <b>cki86201</b> were close behind, coming in with penalty times around the 43
  and 46 minute marks. The cutoff for advancement appears to be 44 points
  (Falling Balls plus Costume Change) plus sufficient solving speed; as usual,
  official results will be mailed out soon.
</p><p>
  Our top 1000 contestants have a weekend with two rounds (Code Jam and
  Distributed Code Jam) coming up in three weeks.
  After that, we will know who will be heading to Toronto!
