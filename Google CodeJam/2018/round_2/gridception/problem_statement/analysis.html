<h3>Code Jam 2018 - Round 2</h3><h1>Analysis: Gridception</h1><h3>Test set 1</h3>
<p>
  This test set can be solved using complete search. We can try enumerating
  every possible connected pattern. For each possible connected pattern, we
  check whether that pattern exists in the grid which has been deepened twice.
  Among all connected patterns which exist in the grid which has been deepened
  twice, we take the one with the largest number of cells. The correctness of
  this algorithm will be proved later in this section.
</p>
<p>
  Note that it is not sufficient to check the pattern in the grid which has been
  deepened only once. The first sample case in the problem description shows
  that there is a pattern which does not exist in the grid which has been
  deepened once, but the pattern exists in the grid which has been deepened
  more than once.
</p>
<p>
  Why is it sufficient to check the pattern in the grid which has been deepened
  twice? We can first observe that a grid which has been deepened X times
  consists of blocks of cells. Each block is a square of cells of the same color
  with side length 2<sup>X</sup>. This does mean any pattern of size at most 3
  &times; 4 can fit in the same block in the grid which has been deepened
  twice, whereas this might not be the case in the grid which has been deepened
  once.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, any pattern of size at most 3 &times; 4 overlaps with at least one
  and at most four blocks in the grid which has been deepened twice. This is
  also the case in the grid which has been deepened more than twice. Therefore,
  the set of patterns of size at most 3 &times; 4 which exists in the grid which
  has been deepened twice is equivalent to the set of patterns of size at most 3
  &times; 4 which exists in the grid which has been deepened X times for any
  X &gt; 2. Therefore, it is sufficient to check the pattern in the grid which
  has been deepened twice.
</p>
<p>
  There are at most O(2<sup><b>R</b> &times; <b>C</b></sup>) patterns.
  Therefore, there are not more than O(2<sup><b>R</b> &times; <b>C</b></sup>)
  possible connected patterns. For each pattern, we can first check whether it
  is connected, and if it is, we can then check whether that pattern exists in
  the grid which has been deepened twice in O(<b>R</b> &times; <b>C</b>) time.
  Therefore, the total complexity of this solution is
  O(2<sup><b>R</b> &times; <b>C</b></sup> &times; <b>R</b> &times; <b>C</b>)
  which is fast enough to solve test set 1.
</p>
<h3>Test set 2</h3>
<p>
  Since <b>R</b> and <b>C</b> can be up to 20, the exponential solution will not
  run in time. Therefore, we must not enumerate every possible connected
  pattern. To solve this test set, we can first observe that a block of cells in
  the grid which has been deepened at least a googol times will have a side
  length larger than the size of any possible pattern.
</p>
<p>
  The observation in the previous paragraph ensures that every possible pattern
  can overlap with at most four blocks of cells in the deepened grid.
  This means that Codd's pattern needs to be divisible into four quadrants by a
  horizontal and a vertical line where each cell of the pattern in the same
  quadrant has the same color. Moreover, that particular combination of four
  colors has to exist in the original grid.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, we can consider every possible quadrant center and combination of
  colors (there are up to O(2<sup>4</sup> &times; <b>R</b> &times; <b>C</b>)).
  For each quadrant center and combination of colors, we want to get the largest
  connected component where each cell in this connected component has the same
  color as the color assigned to the quadrant it belongs to.
</p>
<p>
  For each possible quadrant center and combination of colors, we need
  O(<b>R</b> &times; <b>C</b>) time to find the largest connected component.
  Therefore, this solution will run in
  O(2<sup>4</sup> &times; <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> &times; <b>C</b><sup>2</sup>)
  time.
