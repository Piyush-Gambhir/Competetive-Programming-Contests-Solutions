  Round 3 is the critical Code Jam round that determines who will attend the
  World Finals, and it represents a big step up even from the traditionally
  very difficult Round 2. The later Round 3 problems are usually as hard as our
  typical Finals problems! With twice as many contestants under the new rules
  this year, the competition for the World Finals slots was even more ferocious.
</p><p>
  <i>Field Trip</i> presented what appeared to be a complicated landscape of
  choices, but some careful thought would reveal a deceptively simple solution.
  It was much harder to find any sort of constructive or formulaic solution for
  <i>Name-Preserving Network</i>, though, so contestants had to exercise some
  creativity to solve this interactive problem. The last two problems,
  <i>Raise the Roof</i> and <i>Fence Construction</i>, combined geometry
  &mdash; everyone's favorite programming contest topic! &mdash; with
  algorithmic insights.
</p><p>
  Although many contestants made short work of the first problem, the other
  three proved to be formidable. It wasn't until about halfway through the
  round that every problem had at least one full solve; Fence Construction was
  the last to fall, with <b>Radewoosh</b>'s submission. After it became clear
  that everything was solvable, we saw the usual race to rack up as many points
  as possible, with lots of churning on the leaderboard. <b>Errichto.rekt</b>
  was the first to reach 100 on the optimistic scoreboard; when the final
  results were revealed, there were no perfect scores, but <b>Errichto.rekt</b>
  was still in first with an impressive 81 points. <b>ifsmirnov</b> was second
  with a slightly slower 81, and <b>Golovanov399</b> was third with 77. The
  (provisional) cutoff turned out to be 56 points; our defending champion
  <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> was among those advancing to the Finals.

  We will finalize results (and contact our finalists) soon. In the meantime,
  everyone who was eligible for this round is also eligible for Distributed
  Code Jam, coming up on Sunday.
  Historically, there has been less overlap between the Code Jam and
  Distributed Code Jam finalists than one might expect. Will this pattern hold
  up?
