  This was our first round of Code Jam 2018, and also the very first round on
  our new platform. With over 62,000 registrants, it was one of our biggest
  years ever!
</p><p>
  We hope that you enjoyed the new platform, and we are continuously working to
  smooth down rough edges and add your favorite features from the old platform.
  We had one period of high server load midway through the contest, and we
  apologize to those of you who encountered difficulties submitting attempts
  before we were able to fix the issue.
</p><p>
  On to the problems! The title of <i>Saving The Universe Again</i> was a
  callback to the first problem from our old platform,
  but the two problems were quite different. Fortunately, this decade's
  threat to the universe turned out to be fairly simple to defeat if you came
  up with the right rule. <i>Trouble Sort</i> was also quite approachable if
  you thought through what our (bad!) new sorting algorithm was actually doing.
  It's not the first
  bad sorting algorithm from the Code Jam team,
  either (see Kicksort); we should really stop poring over advanced algorithms journal
  articles and get back to the basics!
</p><p>
  <i>Go, Gopher!</i> was our first interactive problem, and it was open to
  various approaches; the main challenge lay in getting used to the new
  problem type. Finally, we had our traditional oddball Qualification Round D
  problem, though in this case, it was more of an "oddcube" problem:
  <i>Cubic UFO</i> riffed on the plot of the 2017 movie Arrival, and it
  required some serious geometric thinking. Constant-time answers were
  possible, but not required.
</p><p>
  In all, over 24,000 contestants made at least one attempt, and over 21,000
  successfully solved at least one test set. Over 14,000 earned the 25 points
  or more needed to advance to Round 1; official advancement emails will go out
  early next week. If you were one of our qualifiers, we will see you in just a
  week for Round 1A! (After a suspiciously pancake-free Qualification Round,
  what might lie in store?) For those of you who did not qualify, we hope that
  you had fun, and please join us again next year!
