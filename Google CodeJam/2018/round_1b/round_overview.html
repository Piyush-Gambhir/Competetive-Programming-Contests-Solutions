  Round 1B started off with <i>Rounding Error</i>, which explored a phenomenon
  that often arises when interpreting poll results. A greedy insight was
  required to solve the third test set. <i>Mysterious Road Signs</i> challenged
  contestants to understand a strange situation involving signpost numbering.
  Finally, <i>Transmutation</i> was a tough graph problem about producing as
  much lead as possible; contestants had to narrow down the set of possible
  choices in an efficient way.

  This round proved to be really tough for a Round 1. None of the problems
  was really easy in the way some Round 1 problem usually is. To add to that,
  2 out of 3 problems had an extra test set, making a perfect score even harder to
  attain. We had rounds in the past with few perfect scores, but they were usually
  due to a single particularly hard problem. This round featured a good number of
  solutions for each problem individually, but a relatively low number of 37 perfect
  scores. overtroll was the first to get there in just under an hour with no penalty
  attempts, to claim first place.

  In the end, 25 points and some speed and accuracy was needed to get into the top 1500.
  In most cases, that means solving Rounding Error, but you would also advance with
  a full solution of any of the other two problems. It was even possible to advance with
  just visible points, if you managed to get some points from every problem.

  1500 more contestants have advanced to Round 2, and there are 1500 more
  spots available in Round 1C, coming up in a week.
  Good luck!
