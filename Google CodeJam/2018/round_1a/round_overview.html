  We must have been hungry when we designed the problems for Round 1A!
  <i>Waffle Choppers</i> was a slight twist on our usual pancake theme, and it
  may have looked a bit easier than it really was. <i>Bit Party</i> paid
  homage to a certain Canadian treat, and could be solved by using binary search
  in the right way. Finally, <i>Edgy Baking</i> was a problem about cutting
  cookies, but that didn't mean that contestants had to write a "cookie-cutter"
  solution! A dynamic programming approach was possible, but there were other
  possible strategies as well; see our analysis for an interesting one.
</p><p>
  Some of our contestants gobbled up these problems rather quickly! vepifanov
  submitted three correct solutions for a perfect score and the lowest penalty
  time (34 minutes and 36 seconds). Well over 400 contestants achieved perfect
  scores!
</p><p>
  Under the new Code Jam 2018 rules, 1500 contestants advance from each of the
  round 1s; the cutoff for this round ended up being 50 points plus enough
  speed. Those top 1500 contestants from this round are (provisionally) on to
  Round 2! For everyone else, there are still two more chances to advance:
  Round 1B and Round 1C.
  Check out our schedule,
  and mark your calendars!
