  We hope that you enjoyed the practice session! We have re-posted our analyses
  for the three previous Code Jam problems here, and we have also posted an
  analysis and some sample solutions for the new sample interactive problem,
  Number Guessing.

  Number Guessing and its analysis were prepared by Anqi (Joyce) Yang.
  Additional solutions and other help came from Liang Bai, Md Mahbubul
  Hasan, Micah Stairs, and Sasan Tavakkol.
