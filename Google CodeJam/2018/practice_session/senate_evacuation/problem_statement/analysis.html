<h3>Code Jam 2018 - Practice Session</h3><h1>Analysis: Senate Evacuation</h1><h3>Test set 1</h3>
<p>
With at most three parties and at most nine senators, various brute force
approaches will work. One exhaustive strategy is to generate all possible
different evacuation orders, treating senators from the same party as
interchangeable, and then try all possible different ways of chopping those
into groups of one or two senators.
</p><p>
Another, simpler strategy is to keep randomly choosing and trying one of the
nine possible evacuations (A, B, C, AA, AB, AC, BB, BC, CC) as long as the
chosen senator(s) exist and the evacuation will not cause a new absolute
majority. You may worry that this strategy could get stuck, but the outcome of
any legal evacuation will just be another possible test case for the problem,
and the statement guarantees that every test case has a solution! With more
parties and senators, though, this strategy might bog down in the details of
checking the legality of evacuations, so we should come up with a more
efficient approach.
</p>
<h3>Test set 2</h3>
<p>
Intuitively, it is safest to remove one senator at a time, and to always draw
from whichever party has the most remaining senators (or any such largest
party, if there is a tie). But this strategy won't always work! For example,
if we have two senators from party A and two from party B, and no others,
which is a valid test case, then removing one senator from either party will
give the other party an absolute majority.
</p><p>
However, this strategy <i>is</i> always safe whenever there are more than two
parties present. Suppose that party 1 is currently the largest, or tied for the
largest, of at least three parties, and that we remove a single senator from
party 1. Clearly, making party 1 smaller cannot give it an absolute majority
that it didn't have before. But could some other party acquire an absolute
majority as a result? Suppose that the removal of a senator from party 1 were
to cause party 2, which currently has X senators, to have an absolute majority.
But since party 1 was the largest, or tied for the largest, before a senator
was removed, party 1 must still have at least X-1 senators. Moreover, since at
least one more party is present, there is at least 1 other senator who is not
from party 1 or 2. So there are a total of at least X remaining senators who
are not from party 2, which means the X senators of party 2 are not enough to
give it an absolute majority, so we have a contradiction.
</p><p>
If we start with three or more parties and keep evacuating a single senator
from the largest party in this way, then at some point, we must reach a step
in which we go from three parties to two parties. These two remaining parties
must have only one senator each. Since we just removed the one remaining
senator from the third party, it must have been a largest party, so the other
two can be no larger. So we can remove this last pair of senators in a single
evacuation as a final step.
</p><p>
What if we start with two parties? Since the problem statement guarantees that
no party begins with a majority, these parties must have equal numbers of
senators. So, we can evacuate them in pairs, one from each party, until the
evacuation is complete.
</p><p>
This approach takes more steps than are needed &mdash; most of those single
evacuations can be paired up &mdash; but it gets the job done.
