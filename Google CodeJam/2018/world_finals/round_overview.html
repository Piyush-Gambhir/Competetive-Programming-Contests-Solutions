  When a Code Jam final round has five problems instead of six, watch out!
  However, the first two problems were somewhat safe places to start.
  <i>Jurisdiction Restrictions</i> was not exactly a warm-up, but it could be
  solved by piecing together some classic algorithmic techniques in the right
  way. <i>Two-Tiling</i> looked like it had many edge cases, and approaching it
  via casework would have eaten up far too much time, but it was solvable
  with some relatively straightforward backtracking code plus a couple of key
  optimizations.
</p><p>
  The other three problems required even more creativity and coding accuracy.
  <i>Go, Gophers!</i>, our final interactive problem of 2018, was structured
  in a way that shut down obvious approaches, and contestants had to find
  another way in. <i>The Cartesian Job</i> had an outer layer of planar
  geometry that masked a simple but hard-to-find solution. Finally, in
  <i>Swordmaster</i>, understanding the fairly complex scenario was only the
  first step along the way to becoming a virtuoso of dueling (and, perhaps, the
  Code Jam champion!)
</p><p>
  The scoring breakdown was unusual by Code Jam standards; there were two
  "easier" problems worth the same amount, and three harder ones worth the same
  larger amount. This gave the contestants some flexibility to pick their
  preferred problem(s) at a particular point level, but it also did not offer
  many clues about what was hardest! Of course, the three hardest problems
  tested very different skillsets, so it would be difficult to pick an
  objective "most difficult"...
</p><p>
  During the round, Jurisdiction Restrictions and Go, Gopher got a lot of
  attention from contestants; so did the Cartesian Job, which proved to be
  dangerous! By design, it was very difficult to squeeze a floating-point
  solution through. A couple hours in, it became clear that nobody was going
  to solve all five problems, or even four; contestants vied for three, and
  we saw the usual handful of heroic last-minute submissions. By the end of
  the contest, the optimistic scoreboard showed three contestants
  (<b>rng..58</b>, <b>SnapDragon</b>, and <b>LHiC</b>) tied at the
  optimistic score of 124, with two more (<b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> and
  <b>PavelKunyavskiy</b>) following at 104.
</p><p>
  As usual, it isn't over until it's over, and the final reveal changed
  everything! <b>rng..58</b> moved into third with 86 (beating out
  <b>LHiC</b>, who had a higher penalty); <b>Errichto.rekt</b> jumped to
  second place thanks to a truly last-minute Cartesian Job submission. But
  in first, with all 104 of his points surviving judgment, it was our
  now-<u>five</u>-time Code Jam World Champion, <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b>!
  Every problem was solved by at least one contestant; <b>overtroll</b> was
  the only contestant to solve Swordmaster. Congratulations to all of our
  contestants for making it through another very tough problem set! You can

  2018 was an exciting year for Code Jam! Whether you solved a single
  Qualification Round problem, sweated it out in the Finals, or just followed
  along with the contest, we're glad you joined us and we sincerely hope you'll
  do so again next year.
