<h3>Code Jam 2019 - Round 1C</h3><h1>Power Arrangers</h1><h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
  Go, go, Power Arrangers! Everyone loves this team of five superhero high
  school students who wear the letters A, B, C, D, and E. When they stand side
  by side to confront evil monsters, they arrange their team in one of 120
  possible different left-to-right orders, giving them various different
  tactical superpowers. They are even more popular than the Teenage Permutant
  Ninja Turtles!
</p><p>
  Some critics of the show claim that the team only has its arrangment gimmick
  so that the owners of the show can sell 120 separate sets of 5 action figures,
  each of which features the team in a different left-to-right order, glued to
  a base so that the set cannot be rearranged. As an avid Power Arrangers fan,
  you have collected 119 of these sets, but you do not remember which set you
  are missing. Your 119 sets are lined up horizontally along a shelf, such that
  there are a total of 119 &times; 5 = 595 action figures in left-to-right
  order. You do not remember how the sets are arranged, but you know that
  the permutation of the sets is selected uniformly at random from all possible
  permutations, and independently for each case.
</p><p>
  You do not want to waste any time figuring out which set you are missing, so
  you plan to look at the letters on at most <b>F</b> figures on the shelf. For
  instance, you might choose to look at the letter on the eighth figure from
  the left, which would be the third figure from the left in the second set
  from the left. When looking at a figure, you only get the letter from that
  one figure; the letters are hard to see, and the different team members look
  very similar otherwise!
</p><p>
  After checking at most <b>F</b> figures, you must figure out which of the
  sets is missing, so you can complete your collection and be ready to face any
  possible evil threat!
</p>

<h3>Input and output</h3>
<p>
  This is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the
  information in the
  <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/faq#interactive-problems">Interactive Problems section</a>
  of our FAQ.
</p><p>
  Initially, your program should read a single line containing two integers
  <b>T</b>, the number of test cases, and <b>F</b>, the number of figures you
  are allowed to inspect per test case. Then, you need to process <b>T</b> test
  cases.
</p><p>
  Within each test case, the missing set of figures is chosen uniformly at
  random from all possible sets, and the order of the remaining sets is chosen
  uniformly at random from all possible orders as well. Every choice is made
  independently of all other choices and of your inputs.
</p><p>
  In each test case, your program will process up to <b>F</b> + 1 exchanges
  with our judge. You may make up to <b>F</b> exchanges of the following form:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your program outputs one line containing a single integer between 1 and
    595, inclusive, indicating which figure (in left-to-right order along the
    shelf) you wish to look at. As a further example, 589 would represent the
    fourth figure from the left in the second set from the right.
  </li>
  <li>The judge responds with one line containing a single uppercase letter
    <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, or
    <code>E</code>, indicating the letter on that figure. If you sent invalid
    data (e.g., a number out of range, or a malformed line), the judge will
    instead respond with one line containing the single uppercase letter
    <code>N</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Then, after you have made as many of the <b>F</b> exchanges above as you
  want, you must make one more exchange of the following form:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your program outputs one line containing a single string of five
    uppercase letters: the permutation corresponding to the missing set
    (e.g., <code>CADBE</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    The judge responds with one line containing a single uppercase letter:
    <code>Y</code> if your answer was correct, and <code>N</code> if it was not
    (or you provided a malformed line). If you receive <code>Y</code>, you
    should begin the next test case, or stop sending input if there are no
    more test cases.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  After the judge sends <code>N</code> to your input stream (because of either
  invalid data or an incorrect answer), it will not send any other output.
  If your program continues to wait for the judge after receiving
  <code>N</code>, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit
  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program
  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit
  Exceeded error. As usual, if the memory limit is exceeded, or your program
  gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate judgment.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
  1 &le; <b>T</b> &le; 50.<br/>
  Time limit: 40 seconds per test set.<br/>
  Memory limit: 1GB.<br/>
  The missing set, and the order of the remaining sets, are chosen uniformly
  and independently at random.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Test set 1 (Visible)</h4>
<p>
  <b>F</b> = 475.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Test set 2 (Hidden)</h4>
<p>
  <b>F</b> = 150.<br/>
</p>


<h3>Testing Tool</h3>
<p>
  You can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform. To test
  locally, you will need to run the tool in parallel with your code; you can
  use our <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/coding-competitions.appspot.com/interactive_runner.py">interactive runner</a>
  for that. For more information, read the instructions in comments in that
  file, and also check out the
  <a href="/codejam/faq#interactive-problems" target="_blank">Interactive Problems section</a>
  of the FAQ.
</p><p>
  Instructions for the testing tool are included in comments within the tool.
  We encourage you to add your own test cases. Please be advised that although
  the testing tool is intended to simulate the judging system, it is <b>NOT</b>
  the real judging system and might behave differently. If your code passes the
  testing tool but fails the real judge, please check the
  <a href="/codejam/faq#coding" target="_blank">Coding section</a>
  of the FAQ to make sure that you are using the same compiler as us.
