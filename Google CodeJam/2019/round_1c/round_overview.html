  Round 1C continued this year's Round 1 pattern of one "easier" regular
  problem, one "medium" interactive problem, and one hard regular problem.
  <i>Robot Programming Strategy</i> laid out a tournament structure that might
  have seemed hopelessly complicated at first, but the details turned out to
  be mostly unimportant &mdash; your robot just had to be able to win against
  any opponent! Like Draupnir in Round 1B, <i>Power Arrangers</i> made you
  infer some missing information after making careful choices. Finally,
  <i>Bacterial Tactics</i> could be approached with a useful tool for solving
  problems about two-player games.

  By the 25 minute mark, every problem had been fully solved by at least one
  contestant, and the race was on to get that first 100 score! <b>Rafbill</b>
  initially appeared to come out on top with a penalty time of 50:57, but
  later resubmitted and slipped to an overall third place, with a penalty time
  of 1:07:44. <b>logicmachine</b> &mdash; now that sounds like someone who
  knows a thing or two about robot programming strategy! &mdash; moved up to
  win with a penalty time of 54:07. <b>Joisino</b> took the silver with
  58:48. There were 91 perfect scores overall.

  We will be in touch sometime next week to confirm the 1C results; the cutoff
  for rank 1500 appears to be 42 points plus sufficient speed. Solving just the
  first or second problem was unfortunately not quite enough. To those of you
  who did not qualify for Round 2, don't lose heart &mdash; it's tough. Keep
  practicing, and we hope to see you again next year. To the 4500 qualifiers
  from the three Round 1s: get ready, since Round 2 is even tougher! Best of
  luck in winning a T-shirt and advancing to Round 3... and perhaps even the
  World Finals!
