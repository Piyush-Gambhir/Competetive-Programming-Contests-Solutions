  The 2019 Finals presented a full complement of six challenges.
  <i>Board Meeting</i> was our now-customary interactive Finals problem; it
  was not as tough as
  <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000007766/000000000004da2d">last year's</a>
  , but it still required some careful thought about which board positions to
  check. <i>Sorting Permutation Unit</i> presented another design challenge
  &mdash; which permutations would work most efficiently and most generally?
  &mdash; but in a non-interactive format. <i>Won't Sum? Must Now</i> entailed
  building numbers out of a small number of palindromes, thanks to a
  mathematically beautiful guarantee.
</p><p>
  Moving on to the back half of the set, the two Juggle Struggle problems were
  a pair like the
  <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051679/0000000000146183">New Elements problems</a>
  from this year's Round 2, and these two were even more closely related! Part
  2 in particular featured a test set 1 that was quite straightforward, but
  just getting below O(<b>N</b><sup>2</sup>) to O(<b>N</b> log <b>N</b>) proved
  to be one of the toughest hurdles in this year's problem set! Finally,
  <i>Go To Considered Helpful</i> required our contestants to find the shortest
  program to get through a maze; it was not too hard to see that breadth-first
  searches were needed, but the details were as treacherous as the obstacles
  that our fish friend had to avoid.
</p><p>
  At first, our solvers fanned out and worked on different problems.
  <b>ecnerwala</b> went right for the most valuable problem, and solved it just
  over an hour into the contest. Other contestants chipped away at the
  (relatively) easier 27-point problems. At the halfway point, every problem
  except for Juggle Struggle: Part 2 had been fully solved by someone, but
  the judges knew that only <b>ecnerwala</b> and <b>Radewoosh</b> had two full
  solves; <b>xiaowuc1</b> had an impressive four test set 1 solves, but not
  the 124 points displayed on the optimistic scoreboard.
</p><p>
  By the final hour, every problem had been solved (always a goal of the Code
  Jam problem setters!), and several contestants vied fiercely for the top
  triple-digit score, struggling with the age-old Code Jam dilemma: solve more
  test set 1s to rack up potentially tiebreaking points, or go for a big step
  with a test set 2? The lead changed several times, and by the end of the
  contest, we had some huge numbetrs on the board, but how many of those test
  set 2 solves were real?
</p><p>
  When the true results were laid bare, the various ultra-high scores melted
  away, but there were some impressive results underneath! The judges' room
  was hanging on every scoreboard change in the last 15 minutes. For a while,
  it looked as if <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> didn't have enough time to solve
  a full problem to reclaim the lead, but he pulled it off, sealing his win
  with 143 points. <b>rng..58</b> and <b>ecnerwala</b> were behind by a test
  set 2 (and time), at 121 points. <b>mnbvmar</b> took a close fourth with
  118, and <b>Radewoosh</b> had the other triple-digit score at 103.
</p><p>
  Goodbye for now, San Francisco! That's one more Code Jam season in the books,
  and we already can't wait for the next one! (And one more gold medal for
  <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b>!) Congratulations to all of our finalists and
  T-shirt winners, and to everyone who had just the right flash of insight
  needed to solve that tricky problem that had seemed intractable only a few
  minutes earlier. We hope to see all of you &mdash; and more &mdash; back here
  in 2020!
