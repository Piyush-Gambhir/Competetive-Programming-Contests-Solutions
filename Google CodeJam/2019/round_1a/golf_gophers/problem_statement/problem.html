<h3>Code Jam 2019 - Round 1A</h3><h1>Golf Gophers</h1><h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
  Last year, a bunch of pesky gophers took up residence in our orchard. We
  tried to change our line of work by opening up a miniature golf course, but
  it looks like the gophers have followed us here! Once again, we need to
  figure out how many gophers there are, but we cannot observe them directly
  because they are secretive and nocturnal, whereas we like to sleep at night.
  We do know there are between 1 and <b>M</b> gophers, inclusive.
</p><p>
  Our mini golf course is famous for having a small electronic windmill on each
  of its 18 holes. The i-th windmill has 2 &le; <b>B</b><sub>i</sub> &le; 18
  blades, which are numbered from 0 to <b>B</b><sub>i</sub>-1, clockwise. Each
  night, before going to sleep, we turn off the windmills and set each one such
  that blade 0 is pointing downward, which is important so that the windmills
  can charge up properly for the next day. However, we have noticed that when
  we wake up, the windmills have been disturbed. Since our mini golf course is
  in a windless area, we think the mischievous gophers must be responsible!
</p><p>
  We know that every night, all of the gophers emerge, one by one; each of them
  chooses one of the windmills independently and uniformly at random and
  rotates it counterclockwise by one blade. So, for example, for a windmill
  with 3 blades for which 0 is pointing downward, the first gopher to interact
  with it turns it so that 1 is pointing downward, and then the next gophers to
  interact with that windmill make the downward-pointing blade have number 2,
  then 0, then 1, and so on.
</p><p>
  We have devised a plan. We designed our windmills so that we can easily
  change the number of blades (to modulate the difficulty of our course),
  and we will now take advantage of this! Each night, before going to sleep, we
  can choose the number of blades on each of the 18 windmills, within the given
  limits; we do not have to use the same number of blades on each windmill, or
  make the same choices every night. In the morning, we will observe the number
  on each windmill's downward-pointing blade.
</p><p>
  We have <b>N</b> nights in which to figure out G, the number of gophers.
  Can you help us?
</p>

<h3>Input and output</h3>
<p>
  This is an interactive problem. You should make sure you have read the
  information in the <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/faq#interactive-problems">
  Interactive Problems section</a> of our FAQ.
</p><p>
  Initially, your program should read a single line containing three integers
  <b>T</b>, <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>, the number of test cases, the number of
  nights allowed per test case and the maximum number of gophers, respectively.
  Then, you need to process <b>T</b> test cases.
</p><p>
  In each test case, your program processes up to <b>N</b> + 1 exchanges
  with our judge. You may make up to <b>N</b> exchanges of the following form:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your program outputs one line with eighteen integers between 2 and 18,
    inclusive; the i-th of these represents the number of blades you want the
    i-th windmill to have on that night.
  </li>
  <li>The judge responds with one line with eighteen integers; the i-th of
    these represents the number on the downward-pointing blade of the i-th
    windmill in the morning, after the gophers have worked their mischief. If
    you sent invalid data (e.g., a number out of range, or a malformed line),
    the judge instead responds with <code>-1</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  On each night, for each gopher, the choice of which windmill the gopher turns
  is uniform at (pseudo)-random, and independent of any other choice by any
  gopher (including itself) on any night.
</p><p>
  After making between 0 and <b>N</b> exchanges as explained above, you must
  make one more exchange of the following form:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your program outputs one integer: your guess for G, the number of
    gophers.</li>
  <li>
    The judge responds with one line with a single integer: <code>1</code> if
    your answer is correct, and <code>-1</code> if it is not (or you have
    provided a malformed line).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  After the judge sends <code>-1</code> to your input stream (because of either
  invalid data or an incorrect answer), it will not send any other output.
  If your program continues to wait for the judge after receiving
  <code>-1</code>, your program will time out, resulting in a Time Limit
  Exceeded error. Notice that it is your responsibility to have your program
  exit in time to receive a Wrong Answer judgment instead of a Time Limit
  Exceeded error. As usual, if the memory limit is exceeded, or your program
  gets a runtime error, you will receive the appropriate judgment.
</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>
  1 &le; <b>T</b> &le; 20.<br/>
  Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.<br/>
  Memory limit: 1GB.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Test set 1 (Visible)</h4>
<p>
  <b>N</b> = 365.<br/>
  <b>M</b> = 100.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Test set 2 (Hidden)</h4>
<p>
  <b>N</b> = 7.<br/>
  <b>M</b> = 10<sup>6</sup>.<br/>
</p>


<h3>Testing Tool</h3>
<p>
  You can use this testing tool to test locally or on our platform. To test
  locally, you will need to run the tool in parallel with your code; you can
  use our <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/coding-competitions.appspot.com/interactive_runner.py">interactive runner</a>
  for that. For more information, read the instructions in comments in that
  file, and also check out the
  <a href="/codejam/faq#interactive-problems" target="_blank">Interactive Problems section</a>
  of the FAQ.
</p><p>
  Instructions for the testing tool are included in comments within the tool.
  We encourage you to add your own test cases. Please be advised that although
  the testing tool is intended to simulate the judging system, it is <b>NOT</b>
  the real judging system and might behave differently. If your code passes the
  testing tool but fails the real judge, please check the
  <a href="/codejam/faq#coding" target="_blank">Coding section</a>
  of the FAQ to make sure that you are using the same compiler as us.

<h3>Sample Interaction</h3>
<p>
  This interaction corresponds to Test set 1. Suppose that, unbeknownst to us,
  the judge has decided that there are 10 gophers.
</p>
<pre>
  t, n, m = readline_int_list()   // Reads 20 into t, 365 into n and 100 into m.
  // Choose numbers of blades for day 1.
  printline 2 2 2 2 18 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 2 2 to stdout
  flush stdout
  // Reads 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 into res.
  res = readline_int_list()
  // Choose numbers of blades for day 2.
  printline 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 to stdout
  flush stdout
  // Reads 0 1 1 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 into res.
  res = readline_int_list()
  printline 8 to stdout        // We make a wrong guess even though we could
  flush stdout                 // have investigated for up to 363 more nights.
  verdict = readline_int()     // Reads -1 into verdict (judge has decided our
                               //   solution is incorrect)
  exit                         // Exits to avoid an ambiguous TLE error
</pre>
<p>
  Notice that even though the guess was consistent with the information we
  received from the judge, we were still wrong because we did not find the
  correct value.
