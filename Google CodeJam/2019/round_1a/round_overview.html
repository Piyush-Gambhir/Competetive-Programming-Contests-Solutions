  Our first Round 1 of 2019 presented three problems that looked complex, but
  all of them could be tackled with short solutions! <i>Pylons</i> mashed
  together two sci-fi pop culture franchises and asked you to hop around a grid
  in a safe way; it could be solved constructively, but it much easier if you
  thought about brute force, which is sometimes the right approach in the real
  world and even in coding contests! <i>Golf Gophers</i> allowed a lot of
  flexibility in interacting with a system, but the best approach turned out
  not to require much of it. Finally, <i>Alien Rhyme</i> could be solved using
  a trie.
</p><p>
  Because all three problems could be solved with the right insights and short
  pieces of code, we were not <i>too</i> surprised to see a perfect score come
  in after only 25 minutes and 41 seconds. We were even less surprised that it
  came from last year's (and the previous year's, etc.) Code Jam champion,
  <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b>. Fittingly enough, the next perfect score (at
  31:59) came from last year's Distributed Code Jam champion, <b>Radewoosh</b>.
  <b>ksun48</b> was the third to a perfect score, at 37:03. In all, we had
  almost 300 perfect scores! Somewhat unusually for a Code Jam round, our third
  (and highest-valued) problem got more submissions than either of the first
  two &mdash; perhaps it was a little more approachable for experienced
  competitive programmers. 
</p><p>
  Thanks to everyone for competing! We got at least one full submission in 23
  different languages. The cutoff for the top 1500 tentatively appears to be
  45 points plus a sufficiently small penalty time. As usual, it will be a few
  days before we finalize results, but the top 1500 will advance to Round 2 and
  earn a shot to pick up a Code Jam T-shirt. Anyone who did not advance will
  have two more chances to do so; Round 1B is coming up in two weeks!
