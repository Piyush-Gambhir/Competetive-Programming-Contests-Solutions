  We periodically include chemistry-themed problems in Code Jam, and Round 2
  had three! The two parts of <i>New Elements</i> could be solved independently,
  but there were some commonalities, so solving one made it perhaps a bit
  easier to solve the other. <i>Contransmutation</i> was a spiritual successor
  to <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000007764/000000000003675c">this problem from Round 1B 2018</a>,
  and it was similarly challenging. We did take a break from the chemistry lab
  to interactively hack a vase contest in <i>Pottery Lottery</i>.
</p><p>
  This was an uncharacteristically tight round, with the problems having a smaller spread
  of difficulties than usual. This was reflected in the full score for each problem being in the
  twenties. <b>mnbvmar</b> was the first to get a perfect score to claim first place, when there
  was a little over an hour left. <b>ksun48</b> and <b>xyz111</b> followed to
  claim second and third. Overall, only 26 contestants managed a perfect score.
  Getting even a single point was tough in this round, given it
  didn't feature any simple problems, and over 2400 contestants managed to score nonetheless.
  Congratulations!
</p><p>
  Preliminary results indicate that 32 points and some speed are required to advance
  to the next round.
</p><p>
  After the results have been finalized, the top 1000 contestants will win
  well-deserved Code Jam 2019 T-shirts, and will advance to Round 3, where 25
  tickets to the World Finals await! Are you going to San Francisco?
