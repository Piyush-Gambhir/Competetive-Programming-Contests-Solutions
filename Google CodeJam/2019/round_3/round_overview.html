  If you want a ticket to the Finals, it all comes down to Round 3! With only
  two and a half hours and four problems, you have to know what you can solve,
  and solve it <i>fast</i>. The competitors are among the best in the world,
  and there is little room for error!
</p><p>
  The round opened with <i>Zillionim</i>, an interactive coin-taking game in
  which it was far from trivial to outsmart even a randomly playing AI.
  <i>Pancake Pyramid</i> was the obligatory pancake problem &mdash; actually, we
  almost didn't have one at all this year! It was challenging, but approachable
  with more "standard" techniques. <i>Datacenter Duplex</i> and
  <i>Napkin Folding</i> were more unusual, and the latter in particular was a
  very difficult geometry problem. (We wonder how many folded pieces of paper we
  created on our contestants' desks!) Napkin Folding was worth a lot of points,
  but not enough to render the other problems unnecessary.
</p><p>
  After half an hour, each of the first three problems had been fully solved at
  least once. Contestants vied to be the first to finish A + B + C + the first
  test set of D, knowing that the second test set of D was a real monster that
  probably wouldn't get 25 solves. <b>ACRushTC</b> was the first to hit 61
  points, at 1:37:35, followed by <b>rng..58</b> with 1:41:03 and our longtime
  defending champion <b>Gennady.Korotkevich</b> with 1:41:47. The Code Jam
  staff eagerly watched to see if someone would fully solve D, but alas,
  nobody did. That made 61 (or a fast enough 57) the (unofficial) advancement
  bar.

  If you ranked high enough, we will be in touch about the Finals. As always,
  though, making it to Round 3 is a major accomplishment, and you will soon
  have the shirt to prove it! Even if you just watched the contest, preparing
  for next year, you have our thanks and our best wishes for success in 2020.
  In the meantime, though, get ready for the Finals on August 9!
