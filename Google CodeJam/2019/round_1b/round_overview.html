  Round 1B opened with <i>Manhattan Crepe Cart</i>, which became a lot easier
  if you realized that the multiple dimensions in the problem could be handled
  independently. In <i>Draupnir</i>, just as in this year's other interactive
  problems so far, you were able to ask for only a very small amount of data,
  from which you had to extract a lot of information. (Code Jam authors don't
  always attend the opera, but when they do, they end up writing contest
  problems in their heads instead of paying attention!) Finally,
  <i>Fair Fight</i> presented a dueling challenge that was tough even for a
  third Round 1 problem.

  <b>Benq</b> earned our first perfect score, only 29 minutes and 41 seconds
  into the contest (plus 4 minutes for one penalty attempt). Just as in 1A, our
  second perfect score came from a previous Distributed Code Jam champion, and
  in this case a two-time one: <b>bmerry</b>. That was at 42:35, and the third
  perfect score was from <b>alex20030190</b> at 52:17. By the end of the
  contest, there were almost 200 perfect scores &mdash; our contestants never
  cease to impress us!

  This time, the (tentative) cutoff for advancement is 51 points plus a small
  enough penalty time. That corresponds to solving all of the first problem and
  the Visible test sets of the other two. Once again, our interactive problem
  turned out to be a bit tougher than anticipated!
</p><p>
  As usual, we will need some time to review the submissions before finalizing
  the results, but if you make the cut, you can expect confirmation within the
  next few days. Otherwise, next weekend's Round 1C will be the last chance to
  advance to Round 2. Good luck!
