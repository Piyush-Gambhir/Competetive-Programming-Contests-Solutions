  The Code Jam 2019 Qualification Round presented a new interface, some new
  features (in particular, test runs), and, as usual, four new problems!
  <i>Foregone Solution</i> and <i>You Can Go Your Own Way</i> each had two
  Visible test sets and one Hidden test set; solving all of the Visible sets of
  both was enough to earn the 30 points needed to qualify for Round 1, but both
  problems were fully solvable via very short and simple algorithms, if you
  could find them! We wonder how many of you now have lyrics like "you can
  call it another lonely day" stuck in your head.

  As is often the case in the Qual Round, the two later problems were much more
  difficult and unusual. (In fact, such problems often end up in the Qual
  Round precisely because there is more time to think about them, and they are
  mostly optional for advancement.) <i>Cryptopangrams</i> asked you to
  understand a strange new cryptosystem, and it presented a seemingly
  impossible factoring challenge that could be sidestepped in the right way.
  <i>Dat Bae</i> was this season's first interactive problem; like many of our
  interactive problems, it required you to design a clever strategy for getting
  as much information as possible out of a few queries. These problems got
  far fewer solutions than the first two, but we applaud those of you who
  attempted them!
</p><p>
  This was our biggest Qual Round ever, by a wide margin. We had almost 74000
  registrants &mdash; we've finally achieved our dream of overflowing an
  unsigned 16-bit variable! Over 35500 contestants made at least one attempt,
  over 31500 had a positive score, and over 1000 had perfect scores. Every
  language was used in at least one full solution.
</p><p>
  Over 27500 contestants earned at least 30 points and thereby advanced to
  Round 1; the competition in Rounds 1A, 1B, and 1C for those 4500 Round 2
  slots will be intense! If you did not qualify this year, there's always next
  year, and we will soon offer more opportunities to practice with past
  problems on the new platform.
