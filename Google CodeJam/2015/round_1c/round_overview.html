Even though about 2000 contestants had already advanced from Rounds 1A and 1B and weren't in the field for this round, Round 1C was still no picnic.  To advance, contestants needed to solve at least two complete problems, or at least three small inputs and one large input with a fast enough time.
</p>
<p>
The problems were slightly easier than previous rounds.  <i>Brattleship</i> involved finding a winning strategy in a simple game.  The small input had one-dimensional boards, and the large input had two-dimensional boards, so coders had to take additional care before submitting their large input as the small input was not a comprehensive set of cases against which to test their code.  3434 people solved the small input correctly, and almost all of them attempted the large as well, but only two thirds of those attempts passed.
</p>
<p>
<i>Typewriter Monkey</i> could be solved easily in linear time with some insights about string matching and probability.  However, a slower approach using dynamic programming could solve it as well.  The limits were set small enough that a brute force algorithm could solve the small input too.
</p>
<p>
The solution to <i>Less Money, More Problems</i> seems simple, but it was still somewhat difficult to figure out the correct approach.
</p>
<p>
There were 4312 contestants who downloaded at least one input file in Round 1C. 84% of the contestants solved at least one input file, and 132 contestants got a perfect score.

Congratulations to everyone who has now advanced to Round 2!
