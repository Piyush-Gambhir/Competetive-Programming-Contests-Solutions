The problems were much tougher this round; only 10 people got a perfect score!  But 500 contestants advance to round 3, so solving problem A and just the small inputs to problems B and C with a fast enough time was sufficient.
</p>
<p>
<i>Pegman</i> was an easy warmup problem. Over 2000 people solved it!
<i>Kiddie Pool</i> was a simple optimization problem that could be solved with some thinking about the structure of the optimal solution.
<i>Bilingual</i> was another optimization problem, which could be transformed in a non-obvious way such that it can be solved with a network flow algorithm.
<i>Drum Decorator</i> was a difficult dynamic programming problem, which required careful handling of several cases.
