Round 3 was very tough!  The highest score was 73, which four coders reached by solving problems A through D. The lowest score of any of the advancers was only 50!
</p>
<p>
Problems A and B, <i>Fairland</i> and <i>Smoothing Window</i>, were both relatively easy optimization problems.  The problems got much harder from there.  <i>Runaway Quail</i> was a dynamic programming problem, where it was not at all easy to find a polynomial-time solution. 
<i>Log Set</i> required some math and some more dynamic programming.  And for a change of topic, <i>River Flow</i> was a signal processing problem.

Congratulations to all our finalists!  We're looking forward to the finals in Seattle this August!
