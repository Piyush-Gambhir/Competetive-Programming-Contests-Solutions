Our 2015 finals problems were tough enough that no contestant attempted all
six. The scoreboard was a churning battlefield, and we saw all kinds of
solution approaches, such as simulated annealing, in play! Problems C, D, and
E in particular posed a race of insight rather than coding speed, and few
contestants were able to attempt the Large dataset for more than one of them.

At the end of the contest, bmerry was the only contestant who had attempted
the Large dataset of the very challenging Crane Truck problem, and he appeared
to be in the lead... but when the dust settled, it was Gennady.Korotkevich
who emerged on top for the second year in a row. rng..58 came in second; he
had reached the same number of points as Gennady (but with a higher time
penalty) five minutes before the end of the contest, only to have Gennady pull
even farther away less than a minute later! bmerry took third place with the only
other triple-digit score.

Congratulations to all of our finalists and to everyone who participated in
the 2015 Code Jam!
