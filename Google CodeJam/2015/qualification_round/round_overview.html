Google Code Jam 2015 is off and running! We had 56,749 registrants! More than 23,000 people correctly solved at least one input, and more than 12,000 had at least 20 points to advance to the next round.  This was our hardest qualification round ever.

<p>
We opened with <i>Standing Ovation</i> where you had to help your friend who is a prima donna! It required a greedy strategy. Next came <i>Infinite House of Pancakes</i> which involvedâ€¦ pancakes! Then came <i>Dijkstra</i> but the problem wasn't on Dijkstra's algorithm but rather on <i>quaternions</i>. We wrapped up with <i>Ominous Omino</i> which involved <i>Tetris</i>-style blocks.

We are just getting started with GCJ 2015. Congratulations to all the advancers!
