Round 1B was considerably tougher than Round 1A, with no clear “easy” Large input.
Counter Culture is solvable using a fairly simple algorithm, but it’s not trivial to get the details right, and 31% of attempts on the Large input failed.
Noisy Neighbors is an ad hoc problem that requires some clever insight to see the correct strategy, and there's a corner case that is easy to overlook.
Hiking Deer was very challenging for a Round 1 problem -- its second Small input was worth more than each of the other two problems’ Large inputs! Its Large, which set a daunting bar of up to 500000 hikers per test case, was designed to weed out all but the very fastest solutions; only 88 contestants dared to attempt it, of which 52 got it right.

<p>
5619 contestants downloaded at least one input, and at the end of the day, 60.5% of the contestants solved at least one Small or Large input. To advance, it was generally necessary to solve at least three inputs, including at least one Large. Only 30 people (including our defending world champion) got a perfect score.

We hope everybody enjoyed the round! Congratulations to the Top 1000 who have now made it to Round 2.
