Round 1A has 5686 contestants who downloaded at least one input. Contestants faced three challenging problems: Mushroom Monster where Bartholomew wants to determine Kaylin’s minimum rate of eating mushrooms using two different methods (based on a true story!). With 98% correct attempts on the Large input. Haircut was a tricky binary search problem, with the danger of off-by-one errors, and unlike problem A, had only 64% correct attempts of the Large input. The toughest problem was Logging for which contestants needed computational geometry. Most contestants needed everything but C-large to advance, although some solved all of C or C-small plus all of B, or just solved all of A and B very fast.

At the end of the day, 88% of our contestants solved at least one input, and 323 people got everything right (That is really a huge number!).

We hope everybody enjoyed the round! Congratulations to the Top 1000, who have now made it to Round 2; and to everyone else, we'll see you in Rounds 1B and 1C!
