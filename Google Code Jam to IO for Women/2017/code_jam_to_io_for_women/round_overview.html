In our fourth annual Code Jam to I/O for Women contest, we had an immediate burst of activity on the scoreboard. Within 16 minutes, at least one contestant had solved two full problems out of four. The others proved to be more difficult, though; there were no Large submissions for C (or any submissions for D) within the first hour of the contest. Then, solutions for both came trickling in, but the majority of D-Large attempts used an incorrect approach. The first and only completely correct set of submissions came from Taube, with a total penalty time of 2:23:44. Most contestants who reached the top 150 did so by solving all of A and B and C-Small; a combination of speed and accuracy was necessary.

<i>Ticket Trouble</i> was a warm-up problem that alluded to our 2017 Google I/O venue, Shoreline Amphitheatre. This was followed by <i>Understudies</i>, a probability problem with a greedy solution, and <i>Word Search</i>, in which contestants had to construct a letter grid under specific tight constraints. Rounding out this year's set, we had <i>Where Ya Gonna Call?</i>, a challenging graph problem. You can check out the analysis for each problem for more information.

Over 600 contestants made it onto the scoreboard with at least one correct submission! Thanks to everyone who participated, and we hope to see all of you again in next year's contest! Before that, though, there's <a href="https://codejam.withgoogle.com/codejam" target="_blank">Google Code Jam 2017</a>; registration is open through the end of the Qualification Round on April 9.
