  This year's Code Jam to I/O for Women contest was the first to feature a
  multi-part problem: <i>Interleaved Output</i>. In Part 1, the natural greedy
  algorithm did work; however, in Part 2, a small change to the setup forced a
  more complex solution. We hope that you won't see <code>I</code>s and
  <code>O</code>s and <code>i</code>s and <code>o</code>s floating by in your
  dreams! An earlier internal version of the problem had <code>1</code>s
  and <code>0</code>s instead of the lowercase letters, so at least you didn't
  have to parse strings like <code>I1O0</code>...
</p><p>
  The first two test sets of <i>Imbalance Obviation</i> were perhaps more
  approachable than Interleaved Output: Part 2 &mdash; indeed, the whole
  problem could be solved without prior algorithmic knowledge. (Depending on
  your strategy, though, it might have been tricky to handle the odd-length
  cases in Test Set 3!) Finally, <i>Impromptu Outdoor Gallery</i> was a very
  difficult geometry problem about the whims of the art world. Those tickets to
  I/O weren't going to come easily this year!
</p><p>
  Many contestants plowed through Interleaved Output: Part 1; our first
  correct solutions rolled in after only a few minutes. However, the remaining
  problems didn't give up their points without a fight! Even picking off
  Visible test sets took some work. Every test set did get solved at least
  once, but there were no perfect scores. <b>rediska0123</b> came closest (93
  points, 1:41:21), missing only the third test set of Imbalance Obviation.
  <b>kobus</b> (76 points, 1:04:13) came in second, with everything but the
  last test set of Impromptu Outdoor Gallery. <b>tap_tapii</b> (76 points,
  1:09:48), the winner of Code Jam to I/O for Women 2019, was not far behind in
  third. Just over 2500 contestants submitted something, and about half of
  those solved at least one test set.
</p><p>
  We hope you had a great time thinking about the problems, and for those of
  you in the top 150, we'll look forward to seeing you at I/O 2020! To make the
  top 150, you had to earn at least 41 points (generally by completely solving
  the first two problems), or earn 39 points with a sufficiently small penalty
  time. (As usual, we will need a bit of time to finalize the results, so the
  initial rankings are provisional.)

  Thank you, and we'll see you next year with another set of Intriguing
  Offerings!
