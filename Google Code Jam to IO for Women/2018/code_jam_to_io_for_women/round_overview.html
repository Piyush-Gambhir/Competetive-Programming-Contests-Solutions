  Our 2018 I/O contest was our biggest yet! Over 800 contestants solved at least one
  dataset and made it onto the scoreboard.
</p><p>
  <i>Burger Optimization</i> looked complex but turned out to have a relatively
  straightforward solution. <i>CEO Search</i> could be solved in various ways, but
  all of those required a key "greedy" insight and a sensible way to apply it.
  <i>Centrists</i> could be solved by thinking through a small number of
  possibilities. Our D problem is often much tougher than the others, and
  <i>Tricky Trios</i> was no exception; it required probabilistic thinking and
  careful casework. Only 10 contestants solved its Small dataset, which was indeed
  tricky despite presenting only two new test cases, and only 6 solved the Large!
</p><p>
  <b>limli</b> was the first to reach a perfect score, around the halfway mark of
  the contest. <b>mkirsche</b> and <b>crashethereum</b> followed up not too long
  after that to take second and third place.
</p><p>
  Most contestants who made it into the top 150 did so by solving all of A, B,
  and C with a penalty time less than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Congratulations to our
  prize winners, and thanks to everyone for participating!
