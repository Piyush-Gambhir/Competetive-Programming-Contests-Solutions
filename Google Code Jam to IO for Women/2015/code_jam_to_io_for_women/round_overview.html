<p>
This was our second Code Jam to I/O for Women. This year over 200 contestants attempted at least one problem. Every problem was solved by at least 10 contestants, and five contestants achieved perfect scores. 
</p>

<p>
This year's problems skewed a bit mathematical; even the hardest problem, Googlander, which was superficially a graph problem, had an underlying formulaic solution. To earn one of the 100 coveted tickets to I/O, it turned out to be necessary (but not sufficient) to solve any two inputs, most often I/O Error and the small of Dreary Design.

<p>
We hope you had fun with this problem set. We look forward to seeing some of you at I/O and all of you back next year!
