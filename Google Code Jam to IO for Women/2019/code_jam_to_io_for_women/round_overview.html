  Our 2019 Code Jam to I/O for Women round was the first round using a
  redesigned UI &mdash; we know there were issues with loading the contest at
  the start of the round, but we hope you enjoyed solving the problems and had
  a smooth experience once the round began. Please don't hesitate to let us
  know if you encountered any issues by emailing codejamio@google.com.
</p><p>
  <i>Grid Escape</i> and <i>Parcel Posts</i> were the two easier problems of
  the four, but both took some thought and had non-obvious edge cases. The
  formidable infinite field of <i>Sheepwalking</i> could be tamed with some
  algebra and memoization. <i>War of the Words</i> was our first interactive
  problem in Code Jam to I/O for Women, and it was quite fiendish even on top
  of the challenge of getting used to this problem type &dash; even the first
  test set was tough to pass!
</p><p>
  We had over a thousand participants attempt at least one problem. In the
  first hour of the contest, we saw many solutions to our first two problems,
  but Sheepwalking and especially War of the Words proved to be tougher to
  crack. Only a handful of contestants earned any points on War of the Words,
  and nobody solved the second test set, but we saw some submissions get close!
  Over 60 contestants solved the first three problems, and 10 of those also
  solved test set 1 of War of the Words. Most contestants who got into top 150
  either fully solved the first three problems or fully solved the first two
  with a small enough time penalty.
</p><p>
  Thanks to everyone who participated &mdash; and congratulations to the top
  150! We'll be in touch in the upcoming days, pending finalization of the
  results. We hope to see all of you again next year!
