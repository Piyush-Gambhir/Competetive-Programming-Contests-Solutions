<h3>Code Jam to I/O for Women 2019 - Code Jam to I/O for Women</h3><h1>Analysis: Parcel Posts</h1><h3>Test set 1</h3>
<p>
  Test set 1 has a small upper bound of only 10 for <b>K</b>, which leaves at
  most 9 places where a post can be placed. That means we can just try every
  one of the 2<sup>9</sup> = 512 combinations. For each one, check whether all
  of the produced parcels are valid, and if they all are, update a result if
  the number of posts in this option is larger than it. To check whether a
  parcel is valid, notice the condition is equivalent to checking if the list
  of elevations is not sorted non-decreasingly nor non-increasingly. We can do
  that by either sorting it in both ways and compare whether either is equal to
  the original, or check there exist two consecutive marks with one strictly
  lower than the other, and also two consecutive marks with one stricly higher
  than the other.
</p>
<h3>Test set 2</h3>
<p>
  We can improve upon the exponential time required for the solution in the
  previous paragraph with the following insight: if a parcel between marks i
  and j is valid, so is any extension of it to a parcel between marks i-d and
  j+e for non-negative d and e. So, let i be the westernmost mark such that the
  parcel between marks 0 and i is valid and the parcel between i and <b>K</b>
  is valid. If there is not such an i, then the result is just 0 (no posts
  can be added). We can then prove that there is a way to place a maximum
  number of posts that places a post at mark i and not at any mark west of i.
  If that's true, a greedy algorithm follows: find such i, place a post there,
  and recursively try to place more posts within the [i, <b>K</b>] parcel. This
  algorithm takes O(<b>K</b><sup>2</sup>) time if implemented as described,
  which is fast enough to solve this test set, but a linear time alternative is
  presented in the next paragraph.
</p><p>
  To solve the problem in linear time, we scan the list of elevations from west
  to east, recording when we see consecutive marks in strictly increasing and
  strictly decreasing order. As soon as we have seen both, we found a potential
  i (we don't check if [i, <b>K</b>] is valid just yet, to save time). We add 1
  to the result, reset whether we have seen markings in each order to false,
  and resume scanning (this is equivalent to the recursive step in the previous
  presentation). After the scan is complete, it's possible that the eastmost
  parcel is not valid (since we didn't check it), but we can check it by
  inspecting the value of the same two boolean variables showing whether we saw
  markings in each order since our last reset. If the westmost parcel is not
  valid, the last place we found for a post was not valid, so we subtract 1
  from our running result. Notice that each time we find a place where we can
  place a new post, it means that all previously placed posts were valid. This
  takes a single linear pass and a constant number of updates and checks of 3
  variables at each step (two boolean variables about having seen markings in
  each order, and the result), so the algorithm runs in linear time.
</p><p>
  To prove the main proposition, notice first that the parcel between marks 0
  and j for j &lt; i is never valid by definition of i, so any valid placement
  of posts does not place a post at mark j &lt; i. For the second part, since
  just i is a valid placement, there exists a non-empty valid placement. Let
  L = i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, ..., i<sub>m</sub> be the list of mark
  positions where posts should be added in a valid placement of a maximum
  number m of posts, in increasing order. Then, i &leq; i<sub>1</sub> because
  of the first part, so we can define L' = i, i<sub>2</sub>, ...,
  i<sub>m</sub>. Now we can show L' is also such a list, and one that has i as
  its westernmost post. L' has m posts by definition. The validity of L'
  follows because the parcel between marks 0 and i is valid by definition of i,
  and the parcel between i and i<sub>2</sub> is an extension of the one
  between i<sub>1</sub> and i<sub>2</sub> (because i &leq; i<sub>1</sub> from
  the previous part). All other parcels in L' are also parcels in L, and are
  therefore also valid, so L' is valid.
