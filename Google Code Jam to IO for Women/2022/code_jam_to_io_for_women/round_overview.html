Code Jam to I/O for Women returned for its ninth year. The round started with <i>Inversions Organize</i>, helping the I/O marketing team balance an advertising display. <i>Ingredient Optimization</i> followed where a greedy strategy could help Hathai use her Thai Basil leaves optimally to serve the most customers. Next, things ramped up with <i>Interesting Outing</i> which was a hit for anyone who likes to travel. Learning about diameters of a tree would help one solve this problem. Finally, <i>Inventor Outlasting</i> closed out the set with a game between two friends personifying theme park attraction inventors. You might see theme parks reappear in the future!
