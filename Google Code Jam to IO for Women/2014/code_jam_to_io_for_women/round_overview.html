  This was our first Code Jam to I/O for Women contest. <i>Saturnalia</i> was
  a simple warm-up problem, <i>Zathras</i> entailed implementing a simulation,
  and <i>Seating Chart</i> was a more complex exercise in combinatorics.
  MirandaYang took first place with a perfect score in only 46 minutes! Eight
  other contestants achieved perfect scores.
