Gardel used to sing in the famous "Volver" tango song that 20 years is nothing.
It certainly does not feel that way for Coding Competitions.
With these farewell rounds,
a marvelous maze reaches the exit. Hopefully it was as entertaining and
educational for you to solve it as it was for us to put it together.
</p><p>
For today's rounds we went with a Code Jam-finals setup for everyone:
4 hours, 5 problems, lots of problems with the same score. In this way,
each contestant can trace their own path, as you have done throughout our
history before.
</p><p>
Round A had all problems at newcomer level with all test sets visible,
to align with a Coding Practice With Kick Start round. Round B was
also fully visible, but had increasingly harder problems and required
some techniques, like a Kick Start round. Rounds C and D had hidden test
sets, ad-hoc ideas, some more advanced algorithms and data structures, and
included an interactive problem, to cover the full spectrum of the
Coding Competitions experience.

Problems from these rounds will be up for practice until June 1st so you can get a chance
at all of them before sign-in is disabled on the site.

Thanks to those of you who could join us today, and to everyone who was
around in our long history. It has been amazing. Last words are always hard,
so we can borrow from Gardel the ending of "Volver" that does fit the moment:
"I save hidden a humble hope, which is all the fortune of my heart."
