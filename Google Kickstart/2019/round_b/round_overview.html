  Thank you for participating in our second round for 2019. The first problem, <i>Building Palindromes</i>,
  required an ad-hoc reasoning around optimal decisions and optimizing the implementation via precomputation.
  The second problem, <i>Energy Stones</i>'s solution was based on dynamic programming. The last problem, <i>Diverse Subarray</i>
  was a data structures problem requiring some nice observations.
