  Thank you for participating in Kick Start 2019 Round C. The first problem, <i>Wiggle Walk</i>
  was a robot walk simulation problem that could be optimized by maintaining a set like data structure.
  The second problem, <i>Circuit Board</i>'s solution required to efficiently reduce the problem to
  a classic problem of finding largest rectangle in a histogram. The last problem, <i>Catch Some</i>
  was a nice dynamic programming problem.
