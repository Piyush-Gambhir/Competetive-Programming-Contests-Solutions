<p>
  Thank you for participating in Kick Start’s Round A, especially given some of the issues affecting
  the scoreboard and submitting solutions. We apologize — we’ve heard you and understand these
  issues caused frustration, and our team is working hard to ensure we fix the issue for future rounds.

<p>
  Our first Kick Start round this year featured problems requiring varied skills. The first problem, <i>Training</i>,
  required an ad-hoc reasoning around optimal decisions and optimizing the implementation via precomputation.
  The second problem, <i>Parcel</i>'s solution was based on binary search and the concepts of graph theory. The last problem, <i>Contention</i>
  was a data structures heavy problem requiring some nice observations.
