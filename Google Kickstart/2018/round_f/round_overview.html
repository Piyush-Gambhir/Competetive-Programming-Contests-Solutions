  This Kickstart round began with <i>Common Anagrams</i>, which was a simple strings problem.
  Then came <i>Specializing Villages</i>, which required some good graph theory insights.
  Finally, we had <i>Palindromic Sequence</i>, whose large dataset involved an elegant observation on the possible characters of the required string.
