  This Kickstart round began with <i>No Nine</i>, which was a adhoc problem with an alternate dynamic programming solution.
  Then came <i>Sherlock and the Bit Strings</i>,which could be solved with dynamic programming.
  Finally, we had <i>King's Circle</i>, involving a nice observation augmented by the sweep line technique.
