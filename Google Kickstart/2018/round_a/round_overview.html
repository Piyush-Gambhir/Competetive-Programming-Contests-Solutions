  This Kickstart round began with <i>Even Digits</i>, which was a simple adhoc problem.
  Then came <i>Lucky Dip</i>,which could be solved with some knowledge of basic probability theory.
  Finally, we had <i>Scrambled Words</i>, whose large dataset involved an elegant observation on the number of distinct lengths of words possible given a fixed total length.
