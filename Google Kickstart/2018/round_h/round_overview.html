  This Kickstart round was easier than our previous rounds and began with <i>Big Buttons</i>, which was a simple problem solvable by the <i>Trie</i> data structure.
  Then came <i>Mural</i>, whose large dataset required an interesting insight, but a rather easy implementation.
  Finally, we had <i>Let Me Count The Ways</i>, whose large dataset involved the use of the <i>inclusion-exclusion principle</i>.
