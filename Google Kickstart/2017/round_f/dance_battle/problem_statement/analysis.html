<h3>Kick Start 2017 - Round F</h3><h1>Analysis: Dance Battle</h1><h2>Dance Battle: Analysis</h2>
<p>
  Even before solving the Small dataset, we need to reduce the number of
  options available to us, because the Delay action could allow a dance battle
  to go on forever! A critical initial insight is that we can use Delay to
  sort the opponents and face them in whatever order we want: we can delay
  against everyone else until we face our first desired opponent, then take
  some other non-delay action on that opponent, then keep delaying until we
  face our second desired opponent, and so on.
</p>
<h3>Small dataset</h3>
<p>
  Once we know that we can use Delay to sort, the Small dataset's problem space
  allows us to use brute force. We will consider the worst case, <b>N</b> = 5.
  We can choose one of 5! possible orders in which to face the opponents; for
  each opponent, we choose one of the three other actions (Dance, Truce, or
  Recruit). That is a total of 5! &times; 3<sup>5</sup> = only 29160 possible
  scenarios. We can simulate each of them to make sure that our energy does not
  drop below 1, and our honor does not drop below 0. Then, we take the maximum
  honor value among all valid scenarios. Each simulation takes linear time, so
  the overall time complexity of this strategy is O(<b>N</b>! &times;
  3<sup><b>N</b></sup> &times; <b>N</b>).
</p>
<h3>Large dataset</h3>
<p>
  The brute force method above will not scale to 1000 opponents. Let us devise
  an alternate strategy. For starters, we can observe that we cannot use the
  Recruit action until we have defeated at least one opponent (and gained a
  point of honor) by using Dance. So, if our starting energy level does not
  let us defeat the opponent with the lowest dancing skill, then our best
  option is to use Truce on everyone and finish with 0 honor.
</p><p>
  Suppose that we can defeat at least one opponent by using Dance. Then we have
  no reason not to choose the opponent with the lowest dancing skill, since all
  opponents give the same amount of honor when defeated via Dance. Moreover, we
  may as well continue dancing against the weakest remaining opponent as long
  as we have the energy to do so.
</p><p>
  What happens when we do not have enough energy to Dance against any remaining
  opponent? We can either use Truce to send everyone else away, or Recruit some
  opponent. If we are going to recruit someone, we should pick the opponent
  with the highest energy, since the cost of recruiting any opponent is the
  same. But how do we decide whether to use Recruit or Truce?
</p><p>
  As long as there are at least two opponents remaining, it cannot hurt us to
  recruit the one with the most energy, because after that, we can surely
  defeat at least the one with the least energy. Even if we can defeat only
  one, and that one has the same skill as the opponent we recruited, we have
  lost one honor and gained one honor, and we have had no net change in energy,
  so we are no worse off than if we had used Truce to remove the same two
  opponents.
</p><p>
  So, we can sort the opponent list from lowest to highest energy, and start
  with one pointer at each end. Setting aside the case in which we cannot
  defeat anyone: first, we move our left pointer forward, defeating opponents
  by dancing until we no longer can. Then, as long as there are at least two
  step, recruiting the strongest opponent and gaining energy. We repeat this
  until the pointers meet, or we have one opponent left that we cannot defeat
  (in which case we should use Truce instead of wasting a point of honor by
  using Recruit). Whatever amount of honor we have at that point is our answer.
</p><p>
  This algorithm has an O(<b>N</b> log <b>N</b>) sorting step followed by an
  O(<b>N</b>) execution step. Other O(<b>N</b>) execution steps are possible;
  for example, we can notice that the algorithm above will terminate with the
  pointers either zero or one opponent apart, so we can use partial sums and
  binary search to directly find that point.
