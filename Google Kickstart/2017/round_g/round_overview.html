  This Kickstart round began with <i>Huge Numbers</i>, which could be solved by taking advantage of a basic property of exponents.
  Then came <i>Cards Game</i>, which appeared to be solvable via some complicated greedy approaches,
  but turned out to have an elegant minimum spanning tree approach.
  Finally, we had <i>Matrix Cutting</i>, which involved breaking a large matrix into smaller independent
  submatrices by making horizontal and vertical cuts. It could be solved via dynamic programming.
