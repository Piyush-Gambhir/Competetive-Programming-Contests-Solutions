  This Kickstart round began with <i>Ambiguous Cipher</i>, which required an
  insight about how to decode a message. Then came <i>X Squared</i>, which
  seemed to involve a search with an intractably large space, but could be
  solved by thinking carefully about the starting state. Next was
  <i>Magical Thinking</i>, which presented too many possibilities for brute
  force to handle, but allowed various solution approaches. Finally, we had
  <i>The 4M Corporation</i>, which involved building lists of numbers to meet
  certain requirements, and could even be solved in constant time with enough
  thought!
